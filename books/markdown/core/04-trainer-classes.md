Chapter 4:  
Trainer Classes
Introduction to Trainer Classes
Trainer Classes are a special type of Feature that also 
act as a gateway to a number of related Features. The 
Class itself is the Class Feature for a Trainer Class, and 
it is required to take any other Features in that Class.
Unlike other roleplaying games where a character tends 
to stick to only one class, and multiclassing is rare or 
difficult, in Pokémon Tabletop United, characters are 
expected to take a number of different Classes as they 
gain Levels and advance. Each Trainer Class represents 
a narrow specialty, of which an adventuring Trainer will 
likely pick up several during their journey. 
There is no minimum level to start taking multiple 
classes in Pokémon Tabletop United, but a Trainer can 
only ever take a maximum of four Classes. 
Unless otherwise noted, you can only take any given 
Trainer Class once. Some Classes are known as 
Branching Classes, and you can take them multiple 
times (each time taking up one of your four Class slots), 
choosing different specialties each time, such as Grass 
Ace and Fire Ace within Type Ace.
 
Classes are separated into several categories in Pokémon 
Tabletop United. 
Introductory Classes are basic Classes  that can provide 
the basis for many character builds. They are Ace 
Trainer, Capture Specialist, Commander, Coordinator, 
Hobbyist, and Mentor.
Battling Style Classes specialize in a distinct set of battle 
strategies. They are Cheerleader, Duelist, Enduring 
Soul, Juggler, Rider, Taskmaster, and Trickster. 
Specialist Team Classes collect Pokémon with a 
particular trait and bring out the potential of that trait. 
They are Stat Ace, Style Expert, and Type Ace. 
Professional Classes make use of skills that are less 
tied to the Pokémon League pursuit, such as research 
and crafting, but nonetheless find ways to improve 
their Pokémon and help their allies. They are Chef, 
Chronicler, Fashionista, Researcher, and Survivalist.
Fighter Classes fight alongside their Pokémon. They 
are Athlete, Dancer, Hunter, Martial Artist, Musician, 
Provocateur, Rogue, Roughneck, and Tumbler. 
Supernatural Classes wield superhuman powers. They 
are Aura Guardian, Channeler, Hex Maniac, Ninja, 
Oracle, Sage, Telekinetic, Telepath, and Warper.

How to Read Classes
Trainer Classes are presented similarly to a “Skill Tree” 
format. They begin with a Class Feature which acts as 
the gateway into the rest of the Class and provide a basic 
function that is emblematic of the Class. Remember 
that these Class Features do count for the purposes of 
prerequisites that require a certain number of Features 
within a Class. Trainers may only ever have a maximum 
of four Class Features.  
Description
Each Trainer Class is presented with a description of 
the type of Trainer who embodies that Class. Of course, 
this isn’t meant as an absolute constraint on how to play 
your character, but it’s there to provide an easy guide for 
someone who isn’t sure how they should characterize 
and develop their Trainer. 
Associated Skills
In addition, each Trainer Class has a list of Associated 
Skills. These aren’t necessarily all required for the 
Class, but they are Skills that show up somewhere in 
the prerequisites for the Features in the Class (or as 
prerequisites to its prerequisites), sometimes as the only 
option and sometimes as part of a large set of options.
Roles
Finally, each Trainer Class has a rating assigned to 
its Roles. A total of five points, denoted by Poké Ball 
symbols, are distributed among five different categories 
to rate how much the Class is dedicated towards each 
Role. Note that these don’t rate a Class’s effectiveness 
at the role! They just show how much the Class focuses 
on each role, usually as a rough translation of how many 
Features contribute toward each role. Use these to help 
you pick Classes that suit what you want your character 
to accomplish, but be sure to pick classes which suit the 
flavor of your character first and foremost. 
Active Pokémon Support means the Trainer Class is 
built to use its actions to support and buff their Pokémon. 
This can range from motivating a Pokémon to fight 
better to directing the movement of allies around the 
battlefield. Usually, Classes marked with this role spend 
AP on their Features, use Standard Actions to activate 
them, or a combination of both. Their resources and 
actions are limited and must be carefully budgeted.
Passive Pokémon Support means the Trainer Class 
is made to support their Pokémon but doesn’t require 
actions in combat to do so. Often, this means the 
benefits are acquired outside of combat, such as through 
Tutoring or enhanced training bonuses. Some Classes 
focusing heavily on this role may have activated effects 
in battle, but they tend to be Swift or Free Actions. 
Classes dedicated to this role are less concerned about 
budgeting actions or resources in the middle of battle.
 
Crafting means the Trainer Class focuses on creating 
items that can help both themselves and their allies. 
These Classes often require dedicating resources or time 
to acquiring materials for their craft and usually do not 
have many Features using a Standard Action in battle.
Trainer Combat means the Trainer Class is designed 
to get into the heat of battle themselves and will likely 
use their Standard Actions in battle to fight. Classes 
dedicated to this role tend to have Stat Tags in their 
Features to help Trainers keep up with Pokémon in 
combat. Most of them will grant the Trainer Abilities 
and Moves as well. 
Travel and Investigation means the Trainer Class is 
designed to ease the burdens of travel or aid in out of 
combat situations. This is the most varied role, with 
Classes dedicated to it specializing in activities that range 
from clearing out Wild Pokémon to social maneuvering 
and research to pathfinding in the wilderness. 
Note that these Roles don’t say anything about the flavor 
of a Class. Cheerleader, Taskmaster, and Commander 
are all primarily Active Pokémon Support Classes, but 
they each approach that Role in a very different way. 
When building a Trainer, you neither want to spread 
yourself too thin nor specialize too narrowly. Some roles 
synergize better with others. Mixing Active Pokémon 
Support and Trainer Combat is sometimes difficult, for 
example, because you have a finite number of Standard 
Actions to use in battle and AP per scene, and your 
Classes will compete for those. Static or non-combat 
Roles such as Passive Pokémon Support or Travel and 
Investigation pair well with those active Roles, but if 
you only dedicate yourself to passive effects, you’ll have 
nothing to do in battle yourself or ways to spend AP. 
Crafting is always useful. However, you risk spreading 
your money thin with too many Crafting Classes.

The List of Trainer Classes
Here, you’ll find a list of every Trainer Class in the core Pokémon Tabletop United book. They’re grouped by 
the categories described on the previous pages. Each entry lists the name of the Class, the Skills it uses, a brief 
description, and their ratings for the various roles in PTU. Most Classes give you some flexibility in choosing 
which Skills to use out of their assigned Skills. For Classes with larger Skill lists (3 or more), you usually only need 
to have a couple of those Skills, not all of them! 
Introductory Classes: These Classes are well-rounded and can contribute to nearly any character build without 
forcing you to pick your team to suit a particular strategy. Most of the basic Pokémon Trainer archetypes are 
represented here. Newcomers to PTU should pick one of these Classes as a foundation and expand on their 
characters from there with more specialized Class options.

Battling Style Classes: These Classes are dedicated to particular battling styles. Choosing one of these Classes will 
make a big statement about how your character approaches Pokémon training and battles. Unlike the Specialist 
Team Classes, choosing a Battling Style Class does not require you to become highly selective about your Pokémon 
choices, but certain Pokémon do suit certain battling styles better than others. Characters built using an Introductory 
Class as a foundation easily transition into taking one of these Classes to specialize and develop further.
Cheerleader
Skills: Charm
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Cheerleader expands on the battling style of the Inspired 
Training Feature. They’re able to motivate their allies with Orders and are great for a Trainer with Pokémon that 
can defend and support allies.
Duelist

Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Duelist hones in on the Focused Training Feature and 
the battling style it promotes. Their core mechanic is based on controlling the momentum of battle and gaining 
a steady advantage using one Pokémon at a time without much switching.

immense staying power. They may not aim to hit the hardest, but they will be sure to remain standing at the end 
of the day. 
Juggler
Skills: Acrobatics
Active Pokémon Support: 
Jugglers swiftly swap through their entire Pokémon teams in a fight, forcing opponents to keep on their toes. 
They can make the most of a versatile team by ensuring that they always have the Pokémon they want out facing 
their foes and catching them off guard. 
Rider
Skills: Acrobatics, Athletics
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
Trainer Combat: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Rider makes the most of Agility Training by applying

attackers that get too close. Trainer and Pokémon work in concert to create a devastating combination.
Taskmaster
Skills: Intimidate
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Taskmaster embraces the cruel battling style of the 
Brutal Training Feature. It is a high-risk, high-reward Class that gains an offensive edge at the expense of giving 
their own Pokémon Injuries through a grueling training regime.

Trickster
Skills: Guile
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Tricksters are specialists in commanding their Pokémon to use Status-Class Moves, whether they are inflicting 
their foes with Poison and Burn, flooding the battlefield with Hazards, or weakening their opponents with 
Combat Stage reducing Moves. 
Specialist Team Classes: These Classes have zeroed in on a particular kind of Pokémon they prefer using, and 
taking them will steer your character’s team in that direction. Many prominent Trainers in the Pokémon franchise, 
such as Gym Leaders and their protégés, create specialized teams and would be well represented with these Class-
es. While this list may appear small, it’s simply because each of these Classes has many variations – 5 different Stats 
for Stat Ace and Style Expert each and 18 different Types for Type Ace!
Stat Ace
Skills: Command, Focus
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
A specialist in one of the five Combat Stats: Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. 
Style Expert
Skills: Charm, Command, Guile, Intimidate, Intuition
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
An advanced Contest competitor that specializes in one of the five Contest Stats: Beauty, Cool, Cute, Smart, and 
Tough. They have battling styles that reflect their Contest specialization as well.
Type Ace
Skills: Varies by Type
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
A battler that primarily uses Pokémon of a certain elemental Type. 
Professional Classes: These Classes represent a skillset that one might not expect to see in the life of a wandering 
Trainer, such as an academic field of study or professional skill. These skills often prove useful to battlers, such as 
preparing combat-boosting food as a Chef or breeding Pokémon with the Pokémon Caretaker talents in Researcher, 
but they can all represent professional interests outside of conquering the Pokémon League or Contest Circuit.
Chef
Skills: Intuition
Crafting: 
A crafting Class that creates food for them and their allies, which can provide an instant buff in battle and turn 
the tide. 
Chronicler
Skills: Perception
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Travel and Investigation: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
A perceptive type of Trainer who records everything they run across for posterity. Analyzing their records not 
only gives them insight into people and places, but also an edge in battle and the ability to Tutor Moves to their 
Pokémon.

traps, fight using the environment, and help their allies cope with their surroundings.

during official Pokémon League battles, barring full contact rules, but they are useful while traveling through the 
wilds or confronting criminals. Not all Fighting Classes directly deal damage; some, such as the Dancer, play a 
more supportive role.

Passive Pokémon Support: 
A front-line fighter who specializes in training themselves and boosting their Stats.

er Combat and can be treated similarly to the Fighting Classes, but they often also have utility powers which help

Ace Trainer
Ace Trainers aim to be the very best at Pokémon Battles – and they’re willing to work hard to gain the skills 
to back up this ambition.
More than any other trainer, Ace Trainers are characterized by their dedication and hard working natures. 
Not content to coast by on whatever natural talents they and their Pokémon may develop, Ace Trainers 
tend to study strategy and technique, and train their Pokémon daily to ensure they are prepared for any 
coming battles.
Many people may find an Ace Trainer’s dedication bordering on fanatical, and their dedication to training 
to be cruel to their Pokémon. There may be some truth to this; callous and power-hungry Ace Trainers 
often overwork their Pokémon in their quest to be the best. But many Ace Trainers are able to reach 
understandings with their Pokémon, and working within this partnership, they actually become closer to 
their Pokémon than many other types of trainers.
And regardless of an Ace Trainer’s personal bond with their Pokémon, their constant training is of course 
effective. Other Types of Trainers may be better at pushing Pokémon towards specific goals, but Ace Trainers 
are experts at drawing out a Pokémon’s innate potential. 
In campaigns that feature a Pokémon League challenge, Ace Trainers are likely to be highly interested in 
obtaining Gym Badges and competing in Tournaments. Some may even be interested in competing in 
other events such as Contests or Pokéathlons, to help train their Pokémon.

Capture 
Specialist
Unafraid to brave the dangers of the wilderness in their quest, Capture Specialists are unparalleled in skill 
when using Poké Balls, nets, and other devices to capture Pokémon. Many Capture Specialists are on a 
quest to “Catch ‘Em All”, while others are only interested in catching strong and rare Pokémon, and others 
still may have their own specific criteria, such as only capturing Bug Pokémon.
Capture Specialists are motivated for multiple reasons; some may simply be trying to find the strongest 
Pokémon they can for use in their own personal journey. Others may simply like the challenge. Some 
Capture Pokémon to trade and sell; this kind of Capture Specialists tend to be cold-hearted poachers, who 
capture endangered Pokémon, or devastate entire wild communities in their search for profit. Whatever 
their reasons, no one can deny Capture Specialists are good at what they do. 
Capture Specialists tend to be versatile and well-rounded characters; many of them focus on improving 
many different skills such as Perception or Survival, to aid them in their quests into the wilderness. Many of 
them also learn to create and modify their own Poké Balls, to cut down on the costs of their chosen career.

Commander
Commanders are authoritative trainers that focus on Pokémon battling. Commanders prefer to stand in 
the back lines, and direct their allies through battle, like a conductor leading a grand orchestra. Their 
versatility is their greatest strength, and one they are often eager and proud to use.
Commanders tend to be fond of complex plans and tactical set-ups; as such, they make more effective and 
efficient use of the Orders Features that are available to all Trainers through General Features and synergize 
well with other Classes that have their own Orders too. They are experts at organizing deadly and well-
coordinated assaults.

Coordinator
Coordinators specialize not in Pokémon Battles, but in Pokémon Contests. In Pokémon Contests, Pokémon 
compete not to hurt each other, but to use their attacks and abilities to impress the contest judges and the 
watching crowds. The world of Pokémon Contests is just as competitive as the Pokémon Battling scene, 
and so it’s not enough to merely groom a Pokémon’s physical appearance; Coordinators must learn to guide 
their Pokémon to act with grace and charm, and innovate so they can stand out from the crowds. In facing 
these challenges, Coordinators naturally acquire an ability for guidance and leadership, and this talent for 
directing others can even be exploited to their benefit in battle; here they can distract and disrupt enemies, 
or bolster their allies with encouragement or opportunities.
Although many Coordinators shun Pokémon Battles, ironically their training improves the Battle abilities 
of their Pokémon too. Their Pokémon learn to stay calm under pressure and give it their all, whether on the 
stage or the arena. And like Ace Trainers, the sheer amount of dedication Coordinators have towards their 
Pokémon lends itself to making strong bonds with their partners. And this willingness on the part of their 
Pokémon to do their best can make all the difference. 
Coordinators are rare in settings without Pokémon Contests, but that’s not to say they cannot be used there. 
Coordinators can represent trainers who train their Pokémon with poise and polish, and value cohesion 
and dependency over risky maneuvers.

your roll, rounded down. For all rolls, add or subtract 
any modifiers as normal.

Innovation Moves
The Coordinator’s “Innovation” Feature lets the Coordinator create new Moves for their Pokémon. These Moves 
can serve to fill voids in Move Lists for both Battles and Contests and provide utility.
To create a Move, first choose a Contest Type. This affects the Move’s effects and of course its role in Contests.
Next choose a Contest Effect. Look at the “Contest Effects” section (page 266) under “Contests” for the full list. 
Pick one. That’s right, any of them. This determines what the Move does during a Contest, of course.
Third, choose one of the four templates below. This determines the Move’s effects in Battle. These are modified by 
the Contest Type of the Move. Remember, Cool is associated with Attack, Tough with Defense, Beauty with Special 
Attack, Smart with Special Defense, and Cute with Speed.
And finally, name your Move! This is the best part!

Hobbyist
Not all Trainers walk down the path of a narrow specialty. Some Trainers choose to dabble in a variety of 
skills, choosing to learn what’s useful for their immediate journey and then moving on instead of dedicating 
their life to one art. These Hobbyists are fast learners, picking up practical skills easily without necessarily 
having the background or training usually required. 
Trainers who become Hobbyists are usually those who truly do travel across the land, searching far and 
wide. They meet many different Trainers on their journey and can learn from watching them practice their 
skills. 
Fitting their eclectic skillset, Hobbyists rarely display a theme or pattern to the Pokémon they catch, 
choosing to catch whatever is around as they travel. A Hobbyist pairs well with most classes, filling in the 
holes that the more specialized classes have in their skillsets.

Mentor
Not all Pokémon are created equal.  Some are naturally better off due to Species, pedigree, or even just their 
Type or disposition.  On the flip side, many of those on the stronger end of the spectrum are aware of it and 
might have attitude issues with most Trainers.  How do people get around these issues?
 
Some people just show a natural gift for dealing with these troublesome ones.  They have the nurturing 
touch to bring out the best in a Sewaddle and show a Charizard how its arrogance holds it back.  These 
Mentors don’t really seek out problem cases, but when confronted with them have the knowledge and skills 
to handle them appropriately. Their guidance is not lost on Pokémon in the middle of this spectrum either, 
as they can help unlock anyone’s true potential.
 
Mentor is a highly flexible Support Class for dealing with Pokémon with odd Abilities, Natures, and Move 
Lists.  They allow Pokémon to learn moves earlier than they normally would, learn more Moves, and 
change a Pokémon’s very nature.  Most noticeable, however, is they can become Move Tutors with time and 
practice.

Battling Style Classes
Battling Style Classes: These Classes are dedicated to particular battling styles. Choosing one of these Classes will 
make a big statement about how your character approaches Pokémon training and battles. Unlike the Specialist 
Team Classes, choosing a Battling Style Class does not require you to become highly selective about your Pokémon 
choices, but certain Pokémon do suit certain battling styles better than others. Characters built using an Introductory 
Class as a foundation easily transition into taking one of these Classes to specialize and develop further.
Cheerleader
Skills: Charm
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Cheerleader expands on the battling style of the Inspired 
Training Feature. They’re able to motivate their allies with Orders and are great for a Trainer with Pokémon that 
can defend and support allies.
Duelist
Skills: Focus
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Duelist hones in on the Focused Training Feature and 
the battling style it promotes. Their core mechanic is based on controlling the momentum of battle and gaining 
a steady advantage using one Pokémon at a time without much switching. 
Enduring Soul
Skills: Athletics, Focus
Passive Pokémon Support: 
A defensive Class that seeks to outlast its opponents, the Enduring Soul can give even the most frail Pokémon 
immense staying power. They may not aim to hit the hardest, but they will be sure to remain standing at the end 
of the day. 
Juggler
Skills: Acrobatics
Active Pokémon Support: 
Jugglers swiftly swap through their entire Pokémon teams in a fight, forcing opponents to keep on their toes. 
They can make the most of a versatile team by ensuring that they always have the Pokémon they want out facing 
their foes and catching them off guard. 
Rider
Skills: Acrobatics, Athletics
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
Trainer Combat: 
One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Rider makes the most of Agility Training by applying 
it to the art of mounted combat. From the back of their Pokémon, they can bark Orders or swat away would-be 
attackers that get too close. Trainer and Pokémon work in concert to create a devastating combination.

Taskmaster

One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Taskmaster embraces the cruel battling style of the

their own Pokémon Injuries through a grueling training regime. 
Trickster
Skills: Guile
Active Pokémon Support:

Tricksters are specialists in commanding their Pokémon to use Status-Class Moves, whether they are inflicting 
their foes with Poison and Burn, flooding the battlefield with Hazards, or weakening their opponents with 
Combat Stage reducing Moves.

Cheerleader
For some Trainers, the path to victory isn’t paved with complicated strategy or incredibly harsh training. 
Instead, they believe in their Pokémon and try to motivate them to battle to their best, even in the face of 
overwhelming odds. True to their name, Cheerleaders cheer on their Pokémon and drive them to greater 
heights of battle with their optimistic attitudes. 
Cheerleaders bring shine and happiness to traveling groups of Trainers, their words of motivation keeping 
their allies going even after devastating attacks. This doesn’t mean they’re all about blind optimism with 
no substance, however. Cheerleaders need leadership skills, and under their guidance, allies can find their 
second wind or push themselves to act quicker in battle.
Teamed up with cheery and motivating Pokémon, a Cheerleader can keep a traveling party in high spirits 
and fighting at their best all the time.

Duelist
Duelists mark their foes and then let their Pokémon tear them apart with ruthless efficiency. Even in the 
midst of a crowded battlefield, they are able to pinpoint priority targets and ensure their Pokémon have 
the focus to take them down without distraction. Unlike Jugglers, who prefer to rotate through their entire 
roster of Pokémon quickly in a battle, Duelists battle with one Pokémon at a time, building up momentum 
and pushing their advantage further and further. 
Trainers with primarily passive Pokémon support options can take advantage of Duelist’s unique and 
powerful Orders, filling their Standard Actions. This makes Duelist a good counterpart to Classes such as 
Ace Trainer and Stat Ace.

Expert Focus 
2 AP – Standard Action
Target: Your Pokémon under the effects of Focused 
Training

an effect, your Pokémon must have a certain amount 
of Momentum. (Duelist’s Manual does not spend 
Momentum). 
»»

bonuses from Tolerance or Exploit until the end 
of their next turn and may change their Tolerance 
Ability into Exploit, or vice versa, until the end of 
their next turn.
»»
2 Momentum: Your Pokémon’s next Pass, Cone, 
Close Blast, or Burst attack becomes a single target 
Melee attack, or their next Line or Ranged Blast 
attack becomes a single target Ranged attack. If this 
attack hits, the target becomes Vulnerable for one 
full round and has their Initiative set to 0 until the 
end of their next turn. 
»»
3 Momentum: Your Pokémon may act while 
ignoring the Confused, Rage, Infatuation, and 
Suppressed Volatile Status on their next turn as long 
as they attempt to attack a Tagged foe. May only be

deals damage as if it had the Smite keyword. If the 
attack hits, it’s automatically a Critical Hit. If it would 
have already been a Critical Hit, your Pokémon gains 
Hit Points equal to half of its maximum Hit Points. May 
be used only once per Scene per Pokémon .

Enduring Soul
Enduring Souls understand the value of sheer tenacity. Where others would throw in the towel, they keep 
going. Through impressive stamina and focus, they will themselves to victory. It’s just this endurance and 
tenacity that can lead an Enduring Soul’s Pokémon to persevere through Critical Hits and Status Afflictions 
that would cripple lesser Pokémon.
Enduring Soul is a good fit for any trainer that wants to push the endurance of their Pokémon in battle, 
and thus it’s a path most taken by Ace Trainers, Tough Experts, or other classes that specialize in training 
Pokémon, but is also a good fit with classes such as Athlete or Martial Artist that enhance the endurance 
of the Trainer; this way both Pokémon and Trainer can become tougher together. Psychics specializing in 
Focus may find this class an attractive way to enhance their Pokémon as well.

Juggler
Jugglers are quick, clever, and exceptionally dexterous.
In truth, the “Juggler” Class doesn’t need to represent just jugglers, but anyone that’s skilled and quick 
enough to handle Poké Balls with grace and precision. Jugglers can put their natural talents toward combat 
or even contests, but they truly shine in Pokémon Battles, especially when there are no restrictions on 
switching. Jugglers have mastered techniques that help their Pokémon emulate the effects of Pokémon 
Moves such as U-Turn or Baton Pass.
Jugglers pair best with clever and subtle classes that focus on Pokémon Battling; Masterminds and Smart 
Experts are natural fits. Due to their physical inclinations they also pair well with Ninjas, Rogues, or other 
physically oriented trainers that don’t mind raising their Acrobatics.

Rider
In the world of Pokémon, it’s pretty commonplace for Trainers to use their Pokémon to get from place to 
place. Anyone can, with a little practice and maybe a saddle, learn to ride their Rapidash to expedite those 
trips into town or surf on their Lapras to get to faraway islands. Riders elevate this practice into a finely 
tuned combat art, guiding their Pokémon with skill and finesse to outmaneuver their opponents and strike 
with blinding speed. 
Becoming a Rider requires not only coordination and physical training; a good Rider has a strong grasp of 
leadership skills and commands their Pokémon with great spirit. Under the guidance of a skilled Rider, a 
Pokémon delivers devastating charges that can bring down several foes at once or zips across the battlefield 
while leaving a swath of destruction in their wake.
Direct combat Classes like Martial Artist or Ninja are common complements to a Rider because it’s hard to 
avoid being in the midst of battle when you’re riding on your Pokémon!

Taskmaster
Taskmasters are known for their brutal and demanding style, pushing their Pokémon harder in training than 
most other Trainers would dare. Many assume that Taskmasters rule their Pokémon through threats and 
abuse, but some Taskmasters have a deeper understanding with their Pokémon, who accept and embrace 
their grueling training regimes. However, the sad truth is others do indeed mistreat their Pokémon and 
rule through fear, instilling in them an overwhelming need to achieve victory in order to avoid harsh 
consequences.
Regardless of their methods, it can’t be denied that the results are effective. Their brutal training produces 
brutal Pokémon that can better fight through the pain of battle and use cruel techniques on their opponents 
with devastating effect.
Many Taskmasters are Ace Trainers, but they can come from all walks of life; Rogues, Roughnecks, and 
Tough Experts are especially apt to become Taskmasters.

Trickster
Tricksters scorn the direct approach to battle, preferring clever use of Status Afflictions and Hazards over 
pummeling their opponents with overwhelming force. While many Tricksters prefer to turn fights into 
battles of attrition, slowly wearing down their foes with Burn, Poison, and similar effects, others use their 
expertise with Status-Class Moves as part of a versatile arsenal, setting up their opponents for well-timed 
and devastating attacks. 
One needs not do it all when building a Trickster character – in fact, it’s usually to your advantage to focus 
and cherry-pick your Features as this Class covers a wider range of Status-Class Moves than most Trainers 
will regularly use. Combined with an Enduring Soul, a Trickster may rely on Hazards and damage over 
time to outlast their foes. Combined with a Rogue, Pokémon and Trainer can team up to give their enemies 
a double-whammy of disorientation and confusion.

Specialist Team Classes
Specialist Team Classes: These Classes have zeroed in on a particular kind of Pokémon they prefer using, and 
taking them will steer your character’s team in that direction. Many prominent Trainers in the Pokémon franchise, 
such as Gym Leaders and their protégés, create specialized teams and would be well represented with these Class-
es. While this list may appear small, it’s simply because each of these Classes has many variations – 5 different Stats 
for Stat Ace and Style Expert each and 18 different Types for Type Ace!
Stat Ace
Skills: Command, Focus
Passive Pokémon Support: 
Active Pokémon Support: 
A specialist in one of the five Combat Stats: Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. 
Style Expert
Skills: Charm, Command, Guile, Intimidate, Intuition
Active Pokémon Support: 
Passive Pokémon Support: 
An advanced Contest competitor that specializes in one of the five Contest Stats: Beauty, Cool, Cute, Smart, and

Active Pokémon Support: 
A battler that primarily uses Pokémon of a certain elemental Type.

Stat Ace
Stat Aces hold loyalties only to ability. They find Pokémon who are the fastest, or the strongest, or the 
smartest and then, the Stat Ace further improves those abilities. No other Trainer can make a Slowbro act 
with the Speed of a Ninjask.  This focus makes them extremely effective in their element, but might also 
come with the risk of opening themselves up to weaknesses a more well rounded trainer wouldn’t have as 
much issue with.  However, it doesn’t take many blows from an Attack or Special Attack Ace to knock out a 
foe, not many can wear down a Defense or Special Defense Ace, and it’s hard to get a leg up on a Speed Ace. 
 
Stat Ace, as a Class, allows you to customize Pokémon in ways you typically wouldn’t be able to. By allowing 
you to bypass Base Stat Relations for a stat, you can raise Pokémon in rather interesting ways, such as 
having a Gengar focused on physical attacks and taking advantage of its awesome physical movepool. It 
also allows you to further improve Pokémon who are already specialized in a given stat with innate Combat 
Stage bonuses, extra Abilities and bonus stats.

Style Expert
Contest competition is stiff.  Participants have to be prepared to both strut their stuff and know when to 
show their best moves.  Those who delve deep into this practice and develop a particular style are known 
as Style Experts. Much like Stat Aces hone in on a particular trait among Pokémon, Style Experts focus on 
one particular Contest Style – Beauty, Cool, Cute, Smart, or Tough – and strive to embody this ideal, and 
help their Pokémon do so too.   In Battle, Contests, and in life, you can count on Style Experts to act with 
a certain flavor of flair.  
 
The Style Expert Class is much like Stat Ace in that it focuses on a particular Stat – only from the Contest 
perspective.  This isn’t to say they have no applications outside of Contests, however. Where Stat Ace is all 
about teaching Pokémon to battle with an emphasis on their Combat Stat, the Style Expert teaches their 
Pokémon to embody their chosen Contest Stat in ways that can be similarly useful both in and out of battle. 
It’s certainly a similar Class, but with a very different flair.

Type Ace
In a world where most Gyms are based on a particular Type of Pokémon, Type Aces are by far the most 
common of these specialists.  The Type Ace feels a deep bond to a particular Type of Pokémon, and excels 
on raising them.  This tie is so deep that they can with time change the very type of their Pokémon’s Moves, 
or teach a Pokémon to use a Move in a way they normally wouldn’t be able to.  While their weaknesses are 
more pronounced than those of Stat Aces and Style Experts, their strengths are as well.
 
Type Ace is one of the most popular Classes for its thematic importance to the world of Pokémon. The 
ability to change the Type of a Move is also highly valuable to someone who wishes to specialize in a 
rare Type while retaining some versatility on their teams; they can train their off-Type Pokémon to take 
advantage of their specialty Type. Furthermore, Type Aces learn a variety of techniques to better wield their 
Type in battle and often more than make up for any inherent weaknesses of their chosen Type.

Professional Classes
Professional Classes: These Classes represent a skillset that one might not expect to see in the life of a wandering 
Trainer, such as an academic field of study or professional skill. These skills often prove useful to battlers, such as 
preparing combat-boosting food as a Chef or breeding Pokémon with the Pokémon Caretaker talents in Researcher, 
but they can all represent professional interests outside of conquering the Pokémon League or Contest Circuit.

the tide. 
Chronicler

only gives them insight into people and places, but also an edge in battle and the ability to Tutor Moves to their 
Pokémon.

Chef
Anyone that puts a little effort into it can whip up a snack, but Chefs are true culinary masters. Chefs love 
to collect recipes and make food for themselves and their allies. Their choice of recipes dictates their utility; 
they can cook up anything from Bait to Vitamins. Whatever Chefs choose to specialize in, they are sure to 
leave their allies satisfied.
Many Chefs don’t travel, preferring to find gainful employment at a restaurant or other establishment; the 
best chefs can gain quite a lot of fame and even good money this way. Other Chefs take up the profession 
precisely because they’re always on the road, and learning to cook yourself cuts down on costs. 
Note: Chefs need access to a kitchen or to a Cooking Kit to create food. 
When Chefs create a food item, let them fluff it however they like! Perhaps one Chef likes to make puff 
pastries, perhaps another makes healthy treats; perhaps another is a Soup specialist.  Let your players get 
creative in the description of their foods!

Chronicler
Past experience and examples are both great tools for learning.  Even in the realm of Pokémon combat this 
is true; having witnessed a Move and being able to study its dynamics is an extremely useful thing.  And 
what better way to do this than to have it recorded?
 
Chroniclers capitalize on this concept, getting close to the fray and capturing the finest details on how a 
Move is executed, whether through photography, artistic appreciation that later becomes a painting or 
other work of art, or analysis that goes into a journal.  From this they can learn how to best avoid it in the 
future, and potentially even teach their Pokémon to use it.  
 
The Chronicler Class introduces bonuses for keeping Records of Moves and Environments, but its main 
draw is an alternative tutoring method using these Records.  These Features allow you to take the Moves 
you commonly see and turn them against your foes.  Additionally, its low entry requirements and reliance 
on universally useful Skill make it a nice class for Trainers who don’t specialize in Trainer Combat.

Fashionista
Clothes don’t make the man, but they can make the man look great. They’re also unexpectedly influential 
when it comes to raising and battling Pokémon. Held Items can easily turn the tide of battle, and a Fashionista 
is an expert at not only crafting Held Items and outfitting their Pokémon with just the right items for the job 
but giving them and their allies makeovers to fill in where fashion items are lacking.
A Fashionista’s Pokémon shows off stylish Held Items with pizzazz and panache that average Pokémon 
only wish they had. They’ll quickly rotate through a wardrobe of accessories suitable for any situation, waft 
helpful fragrances across the battlefield with their incense, and more. 
Aside from the Incense Items they create and their weather safeguards, a Fashionista is able to fluff their 
Held Items in pretty versatile ways. You could be a hat maker, someone who specializes in scarves and 
shawls, or you could stick to creating little suits and jackets for your Pokémon. Like Chef, Fashionista is a 
good Class to allow a player’s creativity and description shine.

Researcher
The world is a vast place with many complex subjects.  It’s simply not possible for someone to know 
everything about everything, but delving deep into a handful of topics can reap many benefits.  While most 
trainers aim to be the best, Researchers aim to know the most. Researchers become experts on the subjects 
that interest them.  They learn how to apply this information to conflicts off and on the battlefield alike.
 
The Researcher Class is perhaps one of the most difficult and subtle classes to play, but extremely versatile 
in its scope; knowledge is power, after all. Researchers all must choose carefully how to proceed with their 
Features, as their choice of specialization will make a large impact on how they are able to apply their skills. 
Researcher is all about having the knowledge to make the most of any situation or challenge. 
When you choose to take the Researcher Class, you will advance in Fields of Study that represent more 
narrow topics of research. Two characters with the Researcher Class can play very differently as a result! 
Cast’s Note: Making a character heavy in Technology Education but don’t want to focus on Chemistry as 
a Field of Study? The Do Porygon Dream of Mareep? supplement book has three extra Fields of 
Study based on Technology Education, focusing on Poké Ball modification and customization, 
robotics, and cybernetics. Obviously, not all of these will be appropriate for every campaign, 
which is why they’re in a supplement book, but most modern settings can handle a bit of advanced Poké 
Ball tech and use that Field of Study.

Survivalist
Pokémon Trainers often have to travel across the land, searching far and wide to capture new Pokémon or 
find Gyms to challenge. Their journeys bring them through all sorts of exotic environments, from frozen 
tundras to steamy rainforests. Not everyone is cut out for such a harsh journey, but the Survivalist is most 
at home trailblazing through the wilderness.
However, even the most seasoned traveler can’t master all the different terrains and environments of the 
world. It takes a concerted effort for a Survivalist to truly understand a type of geography and how best 
to navigate through it, so each Survivalist will pick up the skills that are most appropriate to their favored 
terrains. Their expertise lets them create improvised traps, fight with the environment, and help their allies 
acclimate to their surroundings in battle.

terrain. When you have 6 Survivalist Features, you may choose a fourth terrain. 
The terrains are: Grassland, Forest, Wetlands, Ocean, Tundra, Mountain, Cave, Urban, Desert
Natural Fighter
[+HP]
Prerequisites: Survivalist
1 AP – Special
Effect: You and your Pokémon become adept at using 
the environment to your advantage in battle. You 
or your Pokémon may activate Natural Fighter as a 
Standard Action to use the Move below corresponding 
to the current terrain. You and your Pokémon must still 
follow all Frequency limitations for the Move.
Grassland: Cotton Spore; Forest: Grass Whistle; 
Wetlands: Mud Slap; Ocean: Aqua Ring; Tundra: Haze; 
Mountain: Smack Down; Cave: Astonish; Urban: Fling; 
Desert: Sand Attack 
Note: GMs! Don’t be super duper strict about the 
terrains here. Obviously a beach is analogous enough 
to a desert to use Sand Attack, and a lake can count as 
ocean terrain. In urban terrain, there’ll probably at least 
be trash around to Fling with the standard 6 DB option. 
On the other hand, most standard arenas for League 
matches won’t qualify for any of the terrains. However, 
some arenas may be specifically designed to emulate a 
terrain type, such as a rocky stadium or a set of floating 
platforms in a pool.

additional effect based on the terrain in which the item 
was made. When foes run into these Hazards, they 
are destroyed after their effects resolve. Pokémon and 
Trainers with Naturewalk for the terrains associated 
with a Hazard are immune to its effects. These items 
must be used the same day they are created or they lose 
all effect.

Dust Trap – Grassland or Desert: A foe that runs

Athlete
Athletes understand that the body is a tool that will go to rust if not taken care of. They endeavor to push 
the limits of their bodies and become better fighters for it. 
Many Athletes tend to not only get plenty of exercise, but often tend to eat healthy and be aware of fitness 
concepts. Others come into the practice through an occupation – dedicated hikers, sport coaches, or even 
Rangers.  Dedicated Martial Artists come easily into the Athlete lifestyle.

Dancer
Dances have been important parts of celebrations and rituals since the birth of civilization. Whether used 
for simple entertainment or for significant religious ceremonies and practices, dance has been passed down 
through the ages just like music, storytelling, and other artistic traditions. No one can say exactly when 
dance became an integral part of human culture, but it’s clear from observing Pokémon such as Spinda 
and Maractus that it has been an important part of life for many living things since before the time of man.
A Dancer has learned to apply the art of dance to life as a Pokémon Trainer in a variety of ways, ranging 
from teaching their Pokémon elegance and tempo to augment their fighting capabilities to applying the 
acrobatic maneuvers of dance to their own battle techniques. This makes the Dancer a flexible Class that 
can appeal to many different Trainers. Martial Artists may use the Class to supplement their offensive 
Moves while Ace Trainers and other more passive Classes may use Dancer Features to play a more active 
support role in battles.

Hunter
The Hunter works in concert with their Pokémon to bring even the most nimble and impressive of opponents 
to their knees. To them, their foes are like prey, and they are experts at using teamwork and pack hunting 
techniques to ensure that no one can escape them. Hunters do not excel at directly attacking their enemies 
and dealing a lot of damage. Instead, much like Capture Specialists, they make use of a variety of tools, such 
as Weighted Nets and Glue Cannons, in order to further limit their enemies’ mobility. 
While Hunters certainly can function very well on their own with just their Pokémon at their side, they excel 
in larger parties too where their allies’ Pokémon can help them surround and trap their foes. Therefore, 
Hunters who prefer to emphasize the Pokémon Support aspects of the Class would do well to pick up 
Classes such as Commander. Hunters who prefer to mix their debilitating tactics with direct assaults might 
choose the Roughneck, Athlete, or Martial Artist Class.

Martial Artist
Martial Artists strive to learn the arts of physical combat, admiring the power of Fighting-Type Pokémon. 
Some may practice Martial Arts as a sport; others out of necessity and survival. Whatever the motivation, 
these trainers hone their bodies into powerful weapons through practice and dedication, and can show 
Pokémon how to do the same.
There are many different styles of Martial Arts, and many emulate various Pokémon. Some trainers learn 
to punch like a Hitmonchan; others to kick like a Hitmonlee. And while the forms and variations are many, 
they all turn Martial Artists into powerful opponents to be feared and respected.
Note: The various Abilities and their associated Moves do in fact correspond to various martial arts in some 
ways; they may not reflect reality, but rather how the styles have been interpreted through various Pokémon 
in the franchise.
Guts: Inspired by Throh, this style resembles Judo or Wrestling.
Inner Focus: Inspired by Sawk, this style resembles Karate. 
Iron Fist: Inspired by Hitmonchan, this style resembles Boxing.
Limber: Inspired by Medicham, this style aims to exploit pressure points and focus Aura.
Reckless: Inspired by Hitmonlee, this style resembles Taekwondo. 
Technician: Inspired by Hitmontop, this style resembles Capoeira.

Musician
Music and art are simply a part of life. It’s something Pokémon and humans alike find joy in, and many 
have devoted their lives and talents to it.  As such the gift of music is found almost everywhere in the world 
– in busy city streets, in a packed arena, at a campfire in the wilderness.  Even in places no humans dwell, 
Pokémon themselves may sing.
 
With time and practice, many have found ways to use their art to help their allies and cripple their foes. 
Sounds can be distracting or painful, or can help lift one’s spirits and get the blood flowing.  As such it’s not 
uncommon to see practiced singers and instrumentalists in both the arenas and the wilds.
 
The Musician class has an array of sound-based Moves at its disposal, making it quite flexible.  It can 
weaken foes, empower allies, and has a few powerful damaging attacks in its arsenal as well.  Its relatively 
low entry requirements make it easily accessible to most character concepts, allowing you to really make it 
what you want.  A guitar wielding rocker, a pop starlet, or the world’s most awesome sax player? Whatever 
way you take it, your adventuring companions will appreciate what you bring to the table.

Provocateur
Striking someone through the heart doesn’t need a weapon.  They often say the pen is mightier than the 
sword, but the mouth is just as effective.  A few choice words can easily make your foes lose their minds, 
whether through rage, befuddlement, or despair.  Who needs to get your hands dirty when your words can 
do all the work for you?
Provocateur is a useful Class for all sorts of builds.  Pokemon support builds can use it to soften up foes 
for their pokemon or allies to finish off more quickly, and combat builds can use it to make their foes more 
vulnerable to their attacks.  Of particular note is the breadth of effects one can get from combining this class 
with Hex Maniac or Roughneck.

Rogue
The streets are a dangerous and eclectic place, where shady lurkers like the Rogue look to make a living off 
of others.  Why work an honest job when you can line your pockets with the wealth of others?  The Rogue 
knows how to hit his enemies when and where they least expect it, to punish them for getting too cocky, to 
kick them while they’re down.
Of course, you can’t always win a straight fight, even when fighting dirty, so ambushing them so they 
don’t have a chance to fight back can always work.  The Rogue class is suited for front-line combatants, 
and pairs up well with other physical classes like Martial Artist and Roughneck.  A Rogue who wants to 
use his mouth as another weapon would likely want to take Provocateur, and of course, Ninjas fit the thief 
archetype nicely.

Roughneck
Fear is a powerful tool in battles, and Roughnecks understand that well. As a Roughneck beats down their 
opponents, they also demoralize them and make it harder for their foe to fight back the longer the fight goes 
on and the more scare tactics they can apply. To make matters even worse for their opponents, Roughnecks 
know how to outlast their enemies in a fight, and they will shrug off blows that would knock out lesser 
fighters.  
Roughneck makes a good counterpart to other Trainer Combat Classes such as Martial Artist or Athlete, 
Provocateur also makes an obvious pairing for Roughneck, especially with the synergy  between Roughneck’s 
Social Moves and Provocateur’s Push Buttons and Quick Wit Features. Roughneck can also be used to give 
a little extra versatility to Classes focused on Pokémon Support such as Taskmaster or Tough Expert.

Tumbler
Tumblers, much like Athletes, put great emphasis on keeping their bodies in shape and pushing their limits. 
Where the two differ is that Tumblers put much more focus on their physical finesse and dexterity than 
they do on power or speed.  They also don’t go to the same lengths to coach their Pokémon to do the same. 
Tumblers don’t like being tied down or staying in one place too long, and not even their own Pokémon are 
going to hold them back!
Acrobatics isn’t just for the circus. The high mobility and speed gained from a life of practiced jumps and 
gives Tumblers an edge in battle that lets them outmaneuver burlier foes.  The Tumbler class provides a 
Trainer with a few additional offensive outlets, but its big draw is mobility; Tumbler is all about jumping, 
moving, and rolling with the punches.  This class provides you a lot of tools to get around a battlefield 
quickly, and ensure that nothing will slow or hold you down.

er Combat and can be treated similarly to the Fighting Classes, but they often also have utility powers which help

Aura Guardian
Aura Guardians have the rare ability to perceive and manipulate Aura, or the spiritual essence of all living 
things. At the most basic level, Aura Guardians can know the intentions and emotions of others at a glance 
simply by viewing their Aura. Aura Guardians can also project their own thoughts to others.
These abilities alone make Aura Guardians a boon to any traveling party, whether for the sake of watching 
out for shady characters on their journey or even for pinpointing other living beings while traveling in the 
dark.
However, with training, Aura Guardians can do even more, projecting and manipulating their Aura to 
take the form of devastating attacks. While similar to the abilities of psionics, the manipulation of Aura 
is fundamentally different in that it uses raw spiritual energy instead of being a product of honed mental 
focus.
Aura Guardians tend to be most at home with Pokémon that can read Auras, though their abilities allow 
them to easily befriend a variety of species.

Channeler
Channelers are humans with rare mystic powers that allow them to commune with Pokémon through their 
auras at a primal level. Often empathetic people with a great intuitive understanding of others’ emotions, 
they can take this expertise to a whole other level with Pokémon, even acting as a conduit to connect the 
hearts of multiple Pokémon at once. For this reason, Channelers are often valued in a traveling party, able 
to understand the intentions of wild Pokémon to avoid conflict or obtain help.
A skilled Channeler is able to play upon this link to their Pokémon companions, becoming a one-man 
reconnaissance team by linking their senses to those of a spread out group of Pokémon. Especially 
experienced Channelers can utilize the conduit between their Pokémon to even greater effect, allowing 
their Pokémon to cover each other’s weaknesses through their channeled link or sharing their preparedness 
for battle.
Channelers are more often kind than cruel due to their deep natural empathy, but some Channelers can 
come to prefer Pokémon to humans, treating other humans with disdain and hostility.

Channeler 
[Class]
Prerequisites: Mystic Senses
At-Will – Swift Action
Target: A Pokémon.
Effect: You Channel the target Pokémon. If you attempt to Channel a Hostile Pokémon, you must make an Intuition 
Check with a DC of 15 to Channel the target. You may stop Channeling a Pokémon as a Free Action at any time. 
You may Channel a number of Pokémon at a time up to your Intuition Rank. If a Channeled Pokémon goes further 
than 20 meters from you, they stop being Channeled. 
Mechanic: While Channeling a Pokémon, it may communicate its intentions, emotions, and motivations to you 
and you may communicate similarly with them; neither party may be deceitful in this exchange. You also become 
aware of all of its Moves, Abilities, and Capabilities. Allied Channeled Pokémon may always attempt Intercept 
Maneuvers for each other, regardless of Loyalty. If you are Fainted, you stop Channeling all Pokémon. Whenever 
you Channel a Pokémon, you have a vague knowledge of what has happened in the Pokémon’s past hour as if they 
were your own memories.
Note: Channeler has a couple Features with the [Orders] tag. However, because they require that a Pokémon be 
Channeled, which isn’t League Legal, they actually aren’t of any use in League Legal battles! 
Shared Senses
Prerequisites: Channeler
Bind 1 AP – Swift Action
Target: A Channeled Pokémon
Effect: You Imprint the target for the duration of this 
Feature. You receive all sensory information being 
sensed by Imprinted Pokémon, and Imprinted Pokémon

you have Imprinted more than one Pokémon, you may 
only concentrate on the senses of one Pokémon at a 
time, and only choose one such Pokémon per round. 
If you stop Channeling a Pokémon, they are no longer 
Imprinted as well.

For each chosen Pokémon that Resists or is Immune 
to the Type of the triggering attack, subtract your 
Intuition Rank from the damage of the attack before all 
calculations.

Hex Maniac
Hex Maniacs are masters of occult practices associated with Ghost-Type Pokémon, and they are capable 
of replicating many of the debilitating Moves that those Pokémon use to cripple their foes. While many 
people would assume that those learning these dark arts are in it for power or petty vengeance, that doesn’t 
have to be the case. The caretakers of Pokémon tombs often turn their expertise in the occult into the Hex 
Maniac’s combat techniques as a matter of practicality. Malicious Ghost-Type Pokémon, grave robbers, and 
those seeking to pilfer powerful artifacts from the sacred sites that are often found near where Ghost-Types 
gather are all good reasons to learn hexes and curses for self-defense. 
Most other Trainer Combat Classes can make good use of a Hex Maniac’s arsenal, even if they aren’t invested 
enough in Special Attack to make Hex effective.

Ninja
Practitioners of the ancient art of ninjutsu, Ninjas are deadly and feared warriors that excel at using eadly 
poisons and clever subterfuge. Being a Ninja means first and foremost having a versatile set of options at 
hand, and thus Ninjas require a broad skillset – they must not only be practiced fighters but also masters 
of stealth. 
A skilled Ninja goes into battle with tools prepared that can be handed off to allies to produce hazards 
for their opponents or countermeasures to the toxins they study. A Ninja’s deceptive arsenal also includes 
poisoned weapons and illusionary clones.
As might be expected, Ninjas tend toward using Poison Type Pokémon or those of a stealthy and subtle 
disposition, but this is not always the case. Sometimes a larger, flashy Pokémon can be the perfect distraction 
for a Ninja trying to sneak by and deliver a decisive blow elsewhere.

you from Aura Sight for its duration. However, the 
Illusion requires complete concentration, and is broken 
if you take any actions at all. Anyone that interacts with 
the Illusion directly may make an Occult Education or 
Intuition Check with a DC equal to 10 plus your Stealth

Oracle
Oracles have trained their mystic abilities to a mastery over past and future. With a few minutes of 
concentration, an Oracle can glean the recent events surrounding an area or object, and their intuitive 
nature often guides them to draw conclusions or find objects that elude the grasp of others. 
This is not to say that Oracles cannot also apply their powers to battle - it turns out that peering into the 
future is quite an advantage in battle. Oracles can use their abilities to more readily assure that their attacks 
and those of their allies strike true or to avoid the attacks of others. Illusions mean nothing to them, and 
they can warn their allies of such supernatural attempts at misdirection.

bypass Substitutes. As a Standard Action, you can create

Disguises and Illusions: Disguises in general refer to 
things with physical components; a mundane disguise 
would be the kind with props and fake moustaches and 
the like. An example of a magical disguise would be a 
Ditto’s transformation. Illusions are magical effects, 
such as the Move Double Team, Substitute, or the 
Illusion Ability.

to deny you access to their senses temporarily without 
ending the effect entirely. You have a rough sense of 
how far away and in what direction marked targets are.

GM’s of the world! It’s up to you to make Scrying and 
Augury fun, and “worth it”.  So here’s some advice.
First, you and your player should negotiate their PC’s 
method for scrying and making auguries. Maybe they 
need to read tea leaves to use this ability; or gaze into 
open flames. Maybe they trigger it “Accidentally” 
while sleeping, or during another mundane activity. 
Maybe they need to pry information from an enigmatic 
Spiritomb that appears to them after they light a 
candle and say a prayer. If you want to be thoroughly 
boring, maybe they only need to focus on activating 
their mystic abilities. Have fun with coming up with 
a method; it should be something that’s relatively easy 
to do though, regardless of their location (don’t make 
them have to buy expensive items to do it each time, or 
to scale a specific mountain in the region just to activate 
this ability!).
Next, consider how you as a GM want to give 
information. You shouldn’t feel obligated to spoil plot 
points that you don’t want to hand out; at the same time, 
this is a great way to give information to a PC that you 
DO want them to know. Don’t be afraid to make things 
vague enough that they don’t make sense at the time, 
but do make sense later; don’t ALWAYS do this though, 
or the warnings given to them by their powers will feel 
more like taunts if they never realize their meaning 
until it’s too late to do anything about it.
Scrying is the more straightforward effect and shouldn’t 
be too difficult. Simply consider how you want to 
present the information. Augury is a bit more subtle. 
Again, don’t be afraid to be vague occasionally, or to 
give incomplete information (e.g. - “You gain a feeling 
you shouldn’t trust <insert name here>, but you don’t 
know why” or “You see a rare herd of Kangaskhan and 
sense that they’re nearby, but you don’t know in which 
direction” are examples of perfectly acceptable visions).

Sage
If one side of a coin had a Hex Maniac on it, the other side would have a Sage.  These occultists are experts 
on the various protective Blessings that Pokémon are capable of bestowing on their allies, and can replicate 
these effects themselves to protect their allies and selves from harm.  Sages are often the guardians of sacred 
sites, such as shrines dedicated to Legendary Pokémon or historical monuments, and utilize these arts to 
help shield these sites from vandals and criminals.  While they can’t pack a punch themselves, their allies 
will be well guarded enough to do that for them.  
Much like Hex Maniac, Sage doesn’t require much combat investment to get great use out of.  It makes an 
excellent option for a character that focuses on Pokemon Support and wants something defensive to use 
their Standard Actions on.  Healing in combat is scarce in Pokémon Tabletop United, making Sage’s ability 
to shield allies from damage a very valuable asset to a group of traveling trainers.

Blessings would become two Reflect or Light Screen 
Blessings, not three. You may only choose a Blessing 
type once per Scene.

Telekinetic
Masters of one of the most classic supernatural powers, telekinesis, these skilled psionics can manipulate 
and move objects with nothing more than a simple thought. As their powers grow, they become able to lift 
themselves off the ground or even incapacitate a foe by levitating them. 
With a more honed technique, Telekinetics can wield their weapons at a great distance and even summon 
up pure kinetic energy to send their foes flying. Those who find themselves fighting a Telekinetic are often 
stymied by their defensive capabilities, as psionic barriers rise up to block their path and subtle distortions 
in the air divert their attacks.
Teamed up with Psychic Type Pokémon, Telekinetics can easily keep enemies at bay with a continual 
application of telekinetic pushing or barriers, but their powers are just as well suited toward augmenting 
the fighting ability of any other type of Pokémon.

Telepath
It’s hard to keep a secret from a Telepath. They are psionics with a mastery of the mind, both their own and 
others’. With a thought, they can hone their own minds to better focus in a fight, and they can learn to easily 
avoid being caught in friendly fire. 
However, their most iconic ability, and that which gives them their reputation, is the ability to read the 
surface thoughts of others. With training, they can even plant thoughts in others’ heads, guiding them 
toward lines of thinking that better allow their mind reading to get at secrets that aren’t often on someone’s 
mind, or guiding them toward a particular action without them being aware at all of the manipulation. 
Telepaths who dedicate themselves to the combat arts find themselves with the advantage of being able 
to lock onto someone’s movements through their thoughts, ensuring their attacks hit. They can also 
telepathically warn their allies of their next move, ensuring they never cause a casualty through friendly 
fire.

[+Special Defense]
Prerequisites: Telepath
Static
Effect: Choose Gentle Vibe or Telepathy. You gain the

Thought Detection
[+Special Defense]
Prerequisites: Telepathic Awareness 
Scene – Standard Action
Effect: You become aware of the number of living 
Humans or Pokémon within X meters of yourself; X is 
equal to your Focus Rank tripled. Pokémon or Trainers 
with the Mindlock Capability are not detected by this 
Ability. You may only use Thought Detection as long as 
you have the Telepathy Capability. 
Telepathic Warning
[+Special Defense]
Prerequisites: Telepathic Awareness, Expert Focus or 
Intuition
1 AP – Free Action
Trigger: You or an Ally use an Attack
Effect: You’re able to give your allies heed of attacks. 
All allies that would be hit by the attack may take a 
Shift Action as an Interrupt to move out of the area 
of effect of the attack. Using this leaves discoverable 
Psychic Residue on each affected ally. You may only use 
Telepathic Warning as long as you have the Telepath 
Capability.
Mental Assault
[+Special Defense]
Prerequisites: Telepath, Expert Focus or Intuition
Static
Effect: You learn the Moves Extrasensory and Psyshock.
Suggestion
[+Special Defense]
Prerequisites: Honed Mind, Master Focus or Intuition
Bind 1 AP – Standard Action
Target: Pokémon or Trainers
Effect: You smoothly plant a thought into the subject’s 
head that lasts as long as this Feature is Bound. They 
won’t know exactly why or how they thought of it; they 
will naturally assume they thought of it themselves, and 
their brain will attempt to get there as logically as it can. 
The target may not necessarily act on the Suggestion, 
especially if it is against their nature. Using Suggestion 
to plant a specific thought may cause the target to 
think about a specific subject, dredging up surface 
thoughts related to the matter. Using this on a target 
leaves discoverable psychic residue. You may only use 
Suggestion as long as you have the Telepathy Capability, 
though you may keep it Bound without having Telepathy 
active.

Warper
These psionics command only a subtle power over time and space, but that is more than enough to make 
them formidable opponents and useful allies in their own right. The subtlety of their effects can often make 
their presence go unknown, even as they apply little twists and nudges to reality to allow their allies to strike 
true or make difficult athletic maneuvers. 
For players who want to play a psychic who has little control over their powers or is even unaware of them, 
both the base Warper feature and Reality Bender are good representations of subtle changes to reality that 
someone may be completely unaware that they’re doing.
These subtle manipulations are only some of the effects in a Warper’s arsenal, however. They are masters of 
teleportation, often using their powers to narrowly avoid devastating attacks or cross great distances with 
ease. With concentration, they can alter the laws of reality itself over a field of battle, sending Flying Types 
crashing to the ground or freezing a foe’s wounds in time and preventing them from healing.

lowered by 3 for one full round and cannot trigger 
Attacks of Opportunity against you for Shifting until 
the end of your next turn.
Reality Bender 
[+Speed]
Prerequisites: Warper, Expert Guile
Daily – Free Action
Effect: You are able to subconsciously alter the fabric 
of reality to change small facts or circumstances. If 
your character is confronting a “random” event such as 
a die roll, coin flip, or cards being dealt, the character 
may activate this Feature to influence the event. In 
this scenario, the GM provides you with two possible 
outcomes, and you pick one of them to actually occur. 
This means you always decide the outcome of binary 
events such as a coin flip; cheating cards or slot machines 
is much harder, as there are multiple outcomes and you 
only get to pick between two. This Feature can also be 
used to generate common items worth $250 or less that 
the character might normally possess, such as a Potion 
or Poké Ball, when in a pinch. The character just happens 
to find the needed item among their belongings. This 
Feature can only create items you wish to use at that 
moment, and of which you have none available; such as 
needing to heal a Pokémon but having no Potions left. 
Items created with Reality Bender must be used quickly 
after activating the feature and cannot be stored for later.
Doxy: To be clear, this Feature refers to die rolls –in 
game-, not any die rolls used to PLAY the 
game. Also, GMs are encouraged to whap 
any Warpers on the nose with a rolled up 
newspaper if they try to apply to this to combat… 
except, perhaps, if they or their Pokémon attempts to 
use the Move Metronome…
