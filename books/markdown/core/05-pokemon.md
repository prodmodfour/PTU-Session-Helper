Chapter 5: 
Pokémon
Pokémon are the fantastical creatures at the heart and soul of Pokémon Tabletop United, and they are just as 
important as your Trainer’s Features, Edges, and Skills when it comes to defining your character. Some of a new 
Pokémon’s traits are determined by the GM and some by the player. The GM usually determines which Abilities a 
Pokémon has at their current Level in the wild as well as their Nature, but the player assigns their Stat Points when 
they capture a Pokémon. This chapter will walk you through managing your Pokémon and related mechanics.
Basic Pokémon Rules and Introduction
In most settings, Trainers are allowed to carry with them 
a maximum of six Pokémon at a time while traveling. 
The reasoning may vary from setting to setting – in one, 
the potential for Pokémon to be used as weapons and 
tools of violence results in heavy regulation of Pokémon 
training. In other settings, six is simply the regulation 
value because the Pokémon League acknowledges that 
six is the number of Pokémon which a skilled Trainer 
can reasonably split their attention between when 
traveling without neglecting any particular Pokémon.
While a GM may certainly bend this rule for their 
own campaign, it’s recommended from a mechanics 
standpoint as well that PCs be limited to a stable of 
six active Pokémon at once. First of all, it becomes a 
lot more work to track that many Pokémon at a time. 
Second, battles either become much less threatening 
when a Trainer has many more Pokémon to fall back 
on, or they become much longer in order to properly 
present the risk of having a whole team knocked out.
Some exceptions may apply, such as breeders carrying 
around extra Pokémon Eggs that may hatch during 
travel time or Trainers with a entrepreneurial spirit 
carrying Pokémon to  sell to others. The Rune Master 
from the Game of Throhs supplement would benefit 
from being allowed to carry spare Unown for use as 
Glyphs – it’s highly unlikely a Trainer will record stats 
for all of their spares intended to be used in this way, 
after all. 
Extra Pokémon beyond the limit of six are usually 
automatically teleported in their Poké Balls to a Pokémon 
Center for storage or to a Trainer’s affiliated Pokémon 
Professor, if applicable. All of a Trainer’s Pokémon are 
registered to a Trainer ID that allows them to digitally 
retrieve their Pokémon and prove ownership. 
On the following pages you’ll see what a Pokédex entry 
for a Pokémon looks like and a short summary of what 
all the various information means.

Managing Pokémon
Combat Stats
Just like Trainers, Pokémon have Combat Stats, Skills, 
and Capabilities. While most of a Pokémon’s traits 
are defined for an entire species in the Pokédex, their 
Combat Stats are determined by their Trainer’s choices. 
While the GM usually assigns a Pokémon’s Nature and 
Abilities when first caught, the Trainer assigns all of 
their Stat Points up to their current Level.
Start by checking the Pokédex to see the Pokémon’s 
Base Stats. These are your starting point. For example, 
a Charmander has 4 HP, 5 Attack, 4 Defense, 6 Special 
Attack, 5 Special Defense, and 7 Speed.
Next, apply your Pokémon’s Nature. This will simply 
raise one stat, and lower another; HP is only ever raised 
or lowered by 1, but all other stats are raised or lowered 
by 2, respectively, to a minimum of 1. See the following 
page for a list of Pokémon Natures.
Next, add +X Stat Points, where X is the Pokémon’s 
Level plus 10. However, when adding Stat Points, you 
must understand the Base Relations Rule.  
The Base Relations Rule puts a Pokémon’s Base Stats 
in order from highest to lowest. This order must be 
maintained when adding Stat Points. For example, 
with a neutral nature, Charmander has Speed > Special 
Attack > Attack and Special Defense > HP and Defense. 
Here, Speed must always remain higher than other Stats.
Stats that are equal need not be kept equal, however. 
Charmander’s HP and Defense do not need to be kept 
the same; they must merely both follow the rules of base 
relation, each staying under Attack and Special Defense.
Calculate your Pokémon’s Hit Points when you’re done. 
Pokémon have Hit Points  according to the following 
formula:
Pokémon Hit Points = Pokémon Level + (HP x3) + 10
Note that this formula is different than a Trainer’s!
1. Species – This is the species of the Pokémon, of 
course, complete with an image of what an average 
specimen of the species looks like. 
2. Base Stats – A Pokémon’s Base Stats help determine 
how their stats are allocated for battle. 
3. Type – Each Pokémon has one or two elemental 
Types, chosen from the 18 Types in Pokémon. They 
are Bug, Dark, Dragon, Electric, Fairy, Fighting, Fire, 
Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice, Normal, Poison, 
Psychic, Rock, Steel, and Water. 
These Types determine what kinds of attacks are strong 
and weak against a Pokémon and have a general bearing 
on the Pokémon’s traits – certain Types are more likely 
to have particular traits than others. Unlike Pokémon, 
Trainers do not have a Type. 
4. Abilities – Abilities are special gifts separate from 
Moves that Pokémon can use. 
5. Evolution – Many Pokémon undergo a process of 
rapid physical metamorphosis called Evolution. This 
usually occurs over a matter of a few minutes at most 
when certain conditions, listed here, are met. 
6. Size Information – The average height and weight 
of a Pokémon of this species. This may vary between 
individual specimens and a GM could even change this 
average value in their campaign setting. 
7. Breeding Information – This is all the information 
necessary to breed Pokémon. 
8. Diet and Habitat – This information tells you where 
a Pokémon is found and what it needs to eat to survive.
9. Capability List – Capabilities denote both a 
Pokémon’s basic traits such as how fast they can move 
or how high they can jump as well as more specialized 
traits such as being able to see in the dark or lift objects 
with telekinetic powers. 
10. Skill List – Just like Trainers, Pokémon have Skills, 
but they are less malleable than a Trainer’s.
11. Move List – Moves are the primary way a Pokémon 
fights in battle, and they can learn them in four ways 
– natural level up, inherited egg moves, from TMs and 
HMs, and from Move Tutors. 
The next section will go into detail on how to manage 
each aspect of your Pokémon described above.

Because these Charmanders are Level 5, they each have a total of 15 added Stat Points. Both of these Charmanders 
are legal, as each stat follows the Base Relations rule, even though they have applied Stat Points differently.
Furthermore, there are several Features that allow trainers to break Stat Relations; when adding stats, you don’t 
need to “correct” Stats due to the “violations” made due to these features. A Trainer with the “Enduring Soul” 
Feature for example, could raise their Charmander’s HP to match or exceed any other stat, despite the fact that it’s 
at the lowest priority for Base Stat Relations. Furthermore, this trainer would NOT be compelled to raise other 
Stats to “fix” the violations caused by this artificially raised high HP.

*These Natures are neutral; they simply do not affect Base Stats, since they cancel themselves out.
Doxy’s Tip: To generate natures quickly, roll 2d6! The first result determines which Stat is raised, the second 
determines which is lowered. This goes in order; 1 = HP, 2 = Attack, 3 = Defense, 4 = Special Attack, 5 = Special 
Defense, 6 = Speed.  You can also make rolls “semi-random” by setting one dice roll or the other ahead 
of time, or even limiting options.

Nature & Flavor Preference: Pokémon prefer a specific type of flavor based on their Nature. Each Stat correlates 
to a flavor; HP with Salty, Attack with Spicy, Defense with Sour, Special Attack with Dry, Special Defense with 
Bitter, and Speed with Sweet. Pokémon like the flavor associated with the Stat raised by their nature, and dislike 
the flavor associated with the stat lowered by their nature.  Pokémon with neutral natures do not have any flavor 
preferences.
You will use these flavor preferences when feeding your Pokémon special food items, such as the Chef’s Snacks. 
Abilities
In addition to Combat Stats, Pokémon have Abilities 
and Moves that define them in battle. 
All Pokémon are born with a single Ability, chosen 
from their Basic Abilities. Normally the GM will decide 
what Ability a Pokémon starts with, either randomly or 
by choosing one. 
Pokémon gain additional Abilities as they Level up. 
At Level 20, a Pokémon gains a Second Ability, which 
may be chosen from its Basic or Advanced Abilities.
At Level 40, a Pokémon gains a Third Ability, which 
may be chosen from any of its Abilities. 
While Pokémon gain only three Abilities through 
Leveling, many Features and other effects can also grant 
Pokémon additional Abilities. There is a category of 
Abilities called Last Chance Abilities for each Type that 
can often only be gained through these methods and 
not through normal Level progression. 
There is no maximum to the number of Abilities that a 
Pokémon or Trainer may have. 
Moves
Moves are a Pokémon’s battle techniques and have the 
biggest influence on their combat ability. 
Pokémon may learn a maximum of 6 Moves from 
all sources combined. However, certain Abilities and 
Features may allow a Pokémon to bypass this limit. 
A Pokémon may fill as many of its Move slots as it likes 
with Moves from its Natural Move List. This includes 
all Moves gained from Level Up, all Egg Moves, and all 
Tutor Moves marked with an (N). However, no more 
than 3 of a Pokémon’s Moves may be from TMs and 
Move Tutors, with the exception of the Natural Tutor 
Moves noted above. Any Feature that requires Tutor 
Points to cause a Pokémon to learn Moves is considered 
a Tutor.
If a Pokémon learns a Move via TM or Move Tutor that 
it can later learn via Level Up, once the Pokémon has 
the opportunity to learn it naturally, that Move becomes 
counted as a “Natural” Move for the purposes of the 
3-TM/Tutor Move Limit.
Unlike Pokémon, Trainers have no limit to the number 
of Moves they may learn. 
Capabilities
Just like Trainers, Pokémon have Capabilities that 
define traits such as how fast they can run, swim, or fly, 
how much they can lift, and how far they can jump. 
Pokémon also have a number of non-basic capabilities 
that define their special abilities such as shrinking in size, 
breathing underwater, exercising psychic powers, and 
seeing in the dark. Certain Trainer Classes and pieces of 
Equipment may grant humans these capabilities as well, 
though it is rare.  See page 303 for a list. 
Unlike Trainers, Pokémon do not derive their 
Capabilities from their Skill Ranks; instead, they are 
determined by their species. Certain Moves can grant 
Capabilities or boost existing Capabilities. These 
bonuses are lost if the Move is ever forgotten. 


## Page 201

Pokémon

Skills
Pokémon have Skills as well, but unlike Trainers, most 
of a Pokémon’s Skills are determined by their species, 
and they have pre-determined modifiers to their Skill 
roll values. 
The Pokédex document assigns each species a roll value 
in Athletics, Acrobatics, Combat, Stealth, Perception, 
and Focus. Some species, such as the Porygon line, 
are assigned additional Skills, in this case Technology 
Education. 
These are the Skills we’ve decided are most determined 
by biology and a Pokémon’s species rather than their 
individual personalities. While these values should be 
sufficient for most situations, there are two cases where 
a GM will want to intervene to make a Pokémon more 
unique among others of its species. 
Assigning Other Skills
Just like in the various mediums for Pokémon media, 
different campaigns will treat the intelligence and 
personality of Pokémon quite differently. 
One campaign make take an approach more akin to 
Pokémon Mystery Dungeon or any other Pokémon 
franchise where the creatures have more human-like 
intelligence and can attain complex knowledge. Another 
campaign might treat them mostly as feral animals. 
It’s left up to the GM to assign social and  Education 
Skills, if they feel it is appropriate for their setting. 
We’ve provided templates below to help in those cases, 
which are generally appropriate for middle or single 
evolutionary stages. Some species will have natural 
tendencies, such as Jiggypuff and other cute Pokémon 
tending to have high Charm rolls, but a campaign can 
just as easily feature rude and obnoxious Jigglypuffs. 
Pokémon Skill Backgrounds
Not all Pokémon of the same species are created exactly 
alike. While Slowpoke are on the whole quite dull and 
lethargic critters, the occasional Slowpoke may be more 
acrobatic than its brethren. Similarly, while most bird 
Pokémon are quite acrobatic and perceptive, this does 
not necessarily hold for all members of the species, and 
it’s just as possible to have a terrifyingly obese Pidove 
who can’t even fly. 
For these cases, create Pokémon Skill Backgrounds 
that operate similarly to a Trainer’s Background. Choose 
one to three skills to raise and an equal number of skills 
to lower by one rank each and treat these as the new 
defaults for the Pokémon’s Skill values. Give a name to 
the Skill Background as well, just as if you were making 
a custom background for your Trainer! A Pacifist Scout 
Background could raise Perception and Stealth while 
lowering Athletics and Combat, for example.
Example Pokémon Skill Templates
Cutesy Heart-Melter
Skills: Intimidate 1d6, Guile 3d6+2, Intuition 2d6+2, 
Charm 4d6+3, Command 2d6
On Evolution: Increase Charm by 1d6 or +2 and one of 
the other skills by the other value.
These Pokémon will win you over with adorable looks, 
but they aren’t above tricking you with crocodile tears too. 
Examples: Clefairy,  Jigglypuff, Audino, Emolga
Snarlyman Taskmaster
Skills: Intimidate 4d6+3, Guile 2d6+2, Intuition 2d6, 
Charm 1d6, Command 3d6+2
On Evolution: Increase Intimidate by 1d6 or +2 and 
one of the other skills by the other value.
These Pokémon lack subtlety, preferring displays of brute 
force to get their way and show leadership.
Examples: Machoke, Durant, Scyther, Nidorino
Playful Trickster
Skills: Intimidate 1d6, Guile 4d6+3, Intuition 3d6+2, 
Charm 2d6+2, Command 2d6
On Evolution: Increase Guile by 1d6 or +2 and one of 
the other skills by the other value. 
These Pokémon are natural liars and pranksters. 
Examples: Klefki, Cottonee, Girafarig, Bonsly
PokéScholar
Skills: an Education Skill at 4d6
On Evolution: Increase Skill by 1d6 or +2
These Pokémon have learned more specialized skills.
Examples: Chansey (Medicine), Unown (Occult)
Of course, you should adjust these for different species. 
A Mawile would have both high Intimidate and high 
Guile. An Altaria has high Charm and Intuition.

Leveling Up
Whenever your Pokémon gains Experience, add its 
Experience to its previous Experience total. If the new 
total reaches the next Level’s “Exp Needed”, the Pokémon 
Levels up. Pokémon have a maximum Level of 100. See 
the next page for the Pokémon Experience Chart.
Whenever your Pokémon Levels up, follow this list: 
»»
First, it gains +1 Stat Point. As always, added Stat 
points must adhere to the Base Relations Rule.
»»
Next, there is the possibility your Pokémon may 
learn a Move or Evolve. Check its Pokédex Entry to 
see if either of these happens. If a Pokémon evolves, 
make sure to then check its new form’s Move List 
to see if it learned any Moves that Level. You may 
choose not to Evolve your Pokémon if you wish.
»»
Finally, your Pokémon may gain a new Ability. This 
happens at Level 20 and Level 40, as detailed in the 
Managing Pokémon: Abilities section (page 200).
Tutor Points
Many Features which permanently change an aspect of 
a Pokémon require a Pokémon to spend “Tutor Points”.
Each Pokémon, upon hatching, starts with a single 
precious Tutor Point. Upon gaining Level 5, and every 
other level evenly divisible by 5 (10, 15, 20, etc.), 
Pokémon gain another Tutor Point.
Tutor Points are stored until used by a TM, Feature, or 
Poké Edge. Once used, Tutor Points are lost forever. 
Most often, these Features teach Moves, but may alter 
other aspects of a Pokémon. Features which apply to 
“your Pokémon” have all effects removed and the Tutor 
Points refunded if those Pokémon are given to another 
Trainer. You can also gain Tutor Points is through Heart 
Boosters, which are vitamins that grant 2 Tutor Points. 
Evolution
Upon Evolving, several changes occur in a Pokémon. 
Take the new form’s Base Stats, apply the Pokémon’s 
Nature again, reapply any Vitamins that were used, and 
then re-Stat the Pokémon, spreading the Stats as you 
wish. Again, Pokémon add +X Stat Points to their Base 
Stats, where X is the Pokémon’s Level plus 10. You must 
of course, still follow the Base Relations Rule.
Then, check Abilities and Moves. Abilities change to 
match the Ability in the same spot in the Evolution’s 
Ability List. When Pokémon Evolve, they can 
immediately learn any Moves that their new form 
learns at a Level lower than their minimum Level for 
Evolution but that their previous form could not learn. 
For example, Snorlax could learn Yawn and Belly Drum.
Finally, check the Pokémon’s Skills and Capabilities and 
update them for its Evolved form. 
Training Pokémon
Sometimes Trainers may wish to train their Pokémon in 
a safe environment. By spending an hour Training with 
their Pokemon, Trainers may apply [Training] Features, 
teach their Pokemon Poke-Edges, trigger Class Features 
such as Ace Trainer, or even grant bonus Experience 
based on their Command Rank. A Trainer can train up 
to 6 Pokémon at a time.
Each day, a Trainer can also apply Experience Training 
to a number of Pokémon equal to their Command Rank. 
A Pokémon may have Experience Training applied to 
them only once per day. Pokémon that have Experience 
Training applied to them gain Experience equal to half 
their own Level, plus a bonus based on their Trainer’s 
Command Rank.
»»
Pathetic or Untrained: 0
»»
Novice or Adept: +5
»»
Expert or Master: +10
»»
Virtuoso: +15
Example: Sylvana is an Ace Trainer with Adept 
Command. She has eight Pokémon - six in her party, 
and 2 in reserve. She can train all the Pokémon in her 
party during the same hour-long training session, but 
she can only give the attention needed to gain EXP to 
four of them. During this time, she can also trigger Ace 
Trainer, apply her Agility Training to her entire party, 
and work with her Pokémon spend Tutor Points to 
help them learn Poké Edges. Since Sylvana is also an 
Athlete, she can use this hour to Train her own Stats 
too! Training can be a very productive hour!

Poké Edges
While many Features allow Tutor Points to be spent to improve your Pokémon, that does not mean Tutor Points 
need to sit idly if you don’t have access to those Features.
After an hour of training, Pokémon may spend Tutor Points to gain any of the Poké Edges listed below, provided 
they meet all prerequisites. If a Pokémon ever loses prerequisites for a Poké Edge they have, it is removed and the 
Tutor Points refunded.
Stat and Skill Poké Edges
Pokémon do not need to be limited by their natural 
inclinations. Trainers can use these Poké Edges to allow 
their Pokémon to excel in unexpected ways. 
Skill Improvement
Prerequisites: None
Cost: 1 Tutor Point
Effect: Rank up one Skill that is currently at or below 
its default level for the species. This Edge may be taken 
multiple times, each time selecting a different Skill.
Note: If Evolution or another permanent effect would 
cause the Skill Rank to go beyond 6, this Poké Edge is 
refunded.
Attack Conflict
Prerequisites: None
Cost: 1 Tutor Points
Effect: Select Attack or Special Attack. From now on, 
that Stat does not need to remain higher than Stats it 
surpasses in Base Relations, and similarly all other Stats 
surpassed by it do not need to remain lower. 
Mixed Sweeper
[Ranked 3]
Rank 1 Prerequisites: Level 10, Invested at least 5 Level-
Up Stat Points into both Attack and Special Attack
Rank 2 Prerequisites: Level 20, Invested at least 10 
Level-Up Stat Points into both Attack and Special Attack
Rank 3 Prerequisites: Level 40, Invested at least 15 
Level-Up Stat Points into both Attack and Special Attack
Cost: 1 Tutor Point each Rank
Effect: Each Rank, the user gains 3 Stat Points to 
distribute freely between HP, Defense, Special Defense, 
or Speed. These bonus points are treated as if they were 
“Level Up” points, and do not alter Base Stats. 
Note: The Stat points gained at Level 1 count as “Level 
Up” points for the purposes of meeting prerequisites, to 
be clear.
Underdog’s Strength
Prerequisites: Level 15, User is an Underdog Pokémon
Cost: 1 Tutor Point
Effect: The user has each of their Base Stats increased by 
+1. The user may no longer undergo Evolution. 
Realized Potential
Prerequisites: Level 30, User is an Underdog Pokémon
Cost: 2 Tutor Points
Effect: Subtract the user’s Species Base Stat Total from 
45. The user gains Bonus Stat Points equal to the remain-
der. These Stat Points must follow Base Stat Relations as 
normal. If the user evolves to a species with a Base Stat 
Total 45 or higher, Realized Potential is removed and 
the Tutor Points refunded.
Note: This is going off of the SPECIES Base Stats. Don’t 
add in Stats from Vitamins, Features, Natures, or any-
thing else. Okay? Okay.
Ability and Move Poké Edges
While all Pokémon can make use of their Abilities and 
Moves, skilled Trainers can teach their Pokémon to 
learn more of those techniques or refine them.
Ability Mastery
Prerequisites: Level 60
Cost: 3 Tutor Points
Effect: The Pokémon gains an additional Ability, picked 
from any Ability it could naturally qualify for.
Advanced Connection
Prerequisites: An Ability with the Connection Keyword
Cost: 1 Tutor Point
Effect: Choose an Ability with the Connection Keyword 
that the target has; the Connected Move no longer takes 
up a Move Slot for the user.

Underdog’s Lessons may be taken up to three times but 
must use the same Final Evolution each time in the case 
of Pokémon with multiple Final Evolutions. 
Capability Poké Edges
Many Pokémon have Special Capabilities that represent 
innate talents made possible by their unique biology 
or elemental powers. While every Pokémon can use 
their family line’s Capabilities, Trainers can guide their 
Pokémon to further hone their skills in these talents.

Mega Evolution
Mega Evolution is a new type of physical transformation 
Pokémon can undergo akin to a temporary evolution. 
A number of different Pokémon can Mega Evolve, 
including some already at a third evolutionary stage. 
Two prerequisites must be met before Mega Evolution 
can occur, however. First, the Pokémon must be holding 
a special type of Held Item called a Mega Stone. Mega 
Stones are specific to an individual species line and 
form; a Mega Stone that works for Charizard would 
not work for Blastoise. Second, their Trainer must be 
wearing an Accessory Slot item called a Mega Ring. 
When a Pokémon Mega Evolves, its Combat Stats 
change, receiving an overall boost (of about 10 points!), 
and it gains a new Ability and sometimes changes its 
Types. The Ability gained from Mega Evolution is always 
added to a Pokémon’s current Ability list and doesn’t 
replace a current Ability. A Pokémon cannot gain two 
instances of the same Ability through Mega Evolution, 
such as Mega Blaziken with Speed Boost. In those cases, 
the Mega Evolution instead grants another Ability the 
user can naturally gain but does not currently have. 
There are two ways you can handle the Stat changes 
from Mega Evolution, depending on how much 
bookkeeping you’re willing to do. You can either apply 
the changes directly to your Pokémon’s current Stats as 
if they were points applied from Level Up, or you can 
apply the changes to their Base Stats and keep a second 
sheet of Stats for your Pokémon’s Mega Evolved form. 
Similar to Darmanitan’s Zen Mode, if you go with the 
latter option, you must keep the HP Stat in both forms 
the same. You may break Base Relations to do so.
Mega Evolution can be triggered on either the Pokémon 
or the Trainer’s turn as a Swift Action. Once triggered, 
a Mega Evolution lasts for the rest of the Scene, even 
if the Pokémon is knocked out. A Mega Ring can only 
support one Mega Evolution at a time, meaning once 
a Trainer Mega Evolves a Pokémon, they can’t Mega 
Evolve any others for the rest of the Scene. 
Unlike other Held Items, Mega Stones cannot be 
removed from their users once Mega Evolution has 
been activated, even through the effects of Moves like 
Knock Off and Abilities like Magician. 
The following Pokémon have Mega Evolved forms, 
which are listed in their Pokédex entries: Venusaur, 
Charizard, Blastoise, Beedrill, Pidgeot, Alakazam, 
Slowbro, Gengar, Kangaskhan, Pinsir, Gyarados, Aero-
dactyl, Mewtwo, Ampharos, Steelix, Scizor, Heracross, 
Houndoom, Tyranitar, Sceptile, Blaziken,  Swampert, 
Gardevoir, Sableye, Mawile, Aggron, Medicham, Man-
ectric, Sharpedo, Camerupt, Altaria, Banette, Absol, 
Glalie, Salamence, Metagross, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, 
Groudon, Rayquaza, Lopunny, Gallade, Garchomp, Lu-
cario, Abomasnow, Audino, Diancie. 
Of course, you may decide to come up with your own 
Mega Evolutions for your campaign, especially as a 
late-game boost to a Trainer’s starter Pokémon. This is 
relatively easy to do. Mega Evolutions give stat changes 
that equal out to a net bonus of +10, usually distributed 
across 3 or 4 different Stats. HP is never changed by a 
Mega Evolution. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves, they 
also gain a new Ability. In addition, a Mega Evolution 
may involve a change in Type.

Sample Pokémon Builds
Pokémon Tabletop United allows a great deal of flexibility when it comes to building your Pokémon. Even with 
the restrictions of the Base Relations rule, you can often build wildly different Pokémon of the same species given 
the proper Nature or customization through Vitamins, Poké Edges, and Trainer Features. However, all of this may 
seem rather daunting to a new player, so we’re providing a few examples here for common cookie-cutter builds 
that have proven to be effective in the system. 
We’ll be using Venusaur for all of the examples here, partly to help demonstrate the versatility possible within just 
one species and partly to make build comparison easier. We will also be restricting the Pokémon customization to 
distributing Stat Points, choosing Moves (including Egg, TM, and Tutor Move options), and choosing Poké Edges. 
While there are many more options available to Trainers for customizing their Pokémon, we’re trying to keep it 
simple and restricted to what everyone can easily access, no matter their choice of Trainer Classes. 
First, let’s take a look at Venusaur’s relevant basic traits from the Pokédex. You’ll want to have your Pokédex 
document open as welll now to follow along, and you’ll want to refer to the Indices in Chapter 9 as well. All of these 
builds will be made at Level 30, which allows for quite a few options!

The Offensive Tank Build
This common build is designed for reliable offense combined with staying power. It makes compromises on 
its speed in order to better take hits while maintaining offensive power. Generally, with this build you want to 
emphasize HP, your choice of Attack Stat, and Defenses. Often, Offensive Tanks carry a balance in their Defensive 
Stats, but for this example, we’re going to show you a version that emphasizes Special Defense just a little bit more 
in order to better deal with the Special Fire and Ice Type Moves that are Venusaur’s most common weaknesses. 
Nature: Composed (Neutral)
A neutral Nature does fine for this build and allows Venusaur to focus on its special attacks and bulk.

This stat spread gives Venusaur decent attacking power 
with 20 Special Attack while letting it take hits very well. 
HP is also kept as high as possible within Base Relations 
for survivability. Note that Speed is raised by 2 points to 
reach 10. This is to gain a second point of Speed Evasion 
and not really for the Initiative boost. In general, it’s a 
good idea to set Defensive stats or Speed at a multiple 
of 5 when it doesn’t take much investment, in order to 
benefit from increased Evasion values. 


## Page 208

Pokémon

Ability Choices: Photosynthesis, Confidence
Photosynthesis gives this build more staying power over 
the course of multiple battles in one day. 
Confidence is a handy Ability to use to aid allies, and 
because of this Venusaur’s bulk with the Tank build, you 
can generally be fine giving up a turn to activate it.
Moves: Sludge, Leech Seed, Giga Drain, Sleep Powder, 
Hidden Power, Energy Ball
This Venusaur has learned Sludge from its Egg Moves 
and Giga Drain, Energy Ball, and Hidden Power from 
TMs. Sludge and Energy Ball together are a pair of 
reliable STAB Moves that this Venusaur can keep using 
throughout a battle. Giga Drain and Leech Seed help it 
last longer in battle, and Sleep Powder can disable pesky 
foes that might hit its weaknesses. 
The Sweeper Build
This build is intended to quickly dish out a lot of damage and isn’t as concerned about survivability. It  only takes a 
few hits from a Sweeper to take down all but the sturdiest of foes. Sweepers will want to emphasize Speed and their 
choice of an Attack Stat, though HP shouldn’t be neglected either. A Sweeper isn’t intended to last for a long time in 
battle, but making a Pokémon too fragile will simply cripple it. Here, we’ll show you a physical Sweeper Venusaur 
that takes advantage of its better physical type coverage for lots of upfront damage. 
Nature: Naive (+Speed / -Special Defense)
Having such a high Special Attack stat after Nature is applied isn’t ideal, but Poké Edges can allow us to ignore it 
for the purposes of Base Relation, thankfully. Otherwise, this nature puts nothing in the way of raising Venusaur’s 
Speed, which is crucial for the Sweeper build. 
Poké Edges: Attack Conflict (Special Attack)
This simply allows the Venusaur to ignore Special Attack when applying the Base Relation rule.

This stat spread brings Venusaur up to a whopping 
25 Speed, allowing it to outspeed many Pokémon 
around its Level. Its 24 Attack could be higher, but it is 
respectable given Venusaur’s Base Stats. Something you 
might note here is we didn’t follow our own advice with 
bringing the Defensive Stats up to 10 for the Evasion 
boost. The reason is mainly that 5 Speed Evasion will 
cover Venusaur in nearly every situation, barring those 
where Speed Evasion is negated. Also, the additional 
points were better spent in HP to ensure it can set up.
Ability Choices: Photosynthesis, Chlorophyll
To be honest, neither of Venusaur’s Basic Abilities are 
great for a Sweeper build, but Photosynthesis is better 
than Confidence. At least it can allow Venusaur recover 
more quickly between battles. 
Chlorophyll is great for making this speedy Sweeper 
even faster, though we won’t be putting Sunny Day on its 
Move List. Another Pokémon could support it though.
Moves: Razor Leaf, Earthquake, Outrage, Take Down, 
Power Whip, Swords Dance
This Venusaur has learned Power Whip from its Egg 
Moves, Earthquake and Swords Dance from TMs, 
and Outrage from a Tutor. A single Swords Dance will 
bring its Attack up to 36, which will let its many low 
frequency, high damage Moves hit that much harder. If 
Venusaur somehow lasts through unleashing all of its 
low frequency attacks, Razor Leaf is there as an option.

The Disabler Build
This build focuses not on direct damage but instead on inflicting Status Afflictions and wearing down opponents 
over time or playing crowd control. A “Cleric” variant of this kind of build can focus purely on buffing and 
supporting allies, such as with Moves like Aromatherapy and Heal Pulse. Venusaur, however, is more suited to 
debuff its foes, and that is the direction this build will focus on, though it will dip into support as well. Use a 
Meganium if you want a Grass Type Cleric. 
Nature: Impish (+Defense / -Special Attack)
The aim of this Nature is simple: allow Defensive Stats to be raised without limit.

With 100 Hit Points and 21/25 in its Defensive Stats, 
this Venusaur is not going down easy. As with the 
Offensive Tank, this Venusaur adds 2 to its Speed to gain 
an additional Speed Evasion. Without any investment 
in either Attacking Stat, this Venusaur won’t do much 
damage if it’s forced to use Struggle Attacks, but its role 
is to lock down foes with its wide arsenal of Status Moves 
anyhow. Just watch out for Taunt and other effects that 
inflict the Enrage Status. 
Ability Choices: Confidence, Aroma Veil
Confidence allows this Venusaur to take a break from 
disabling and buff its allies. 
Calming Scent is a great Cleric Ability and adds to this 
Venusaur’s support role. 
Moves: Poison Powder, Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, 
Substitute, Synthesis, Attract
This Venusaur has picked up Attract and Substitute 
from TMs and Synthesis from a Tutor. Poison Powder 
and Leech Seed can wear down foes over time, while 
Sleep Powder can disable foes. Synthesis and Substitute 
round off the build with more survivability. 
The Mixed Attacker Build
This build is like the Sweeper but focuses on both Attacking Stats. Usually, Mixed Attackers give up lasting power 
for versatility. Pokémon with Twisted Power do this build better, but Venusaur can manage it with Poké Edges.

Even with this much investment into Attacking Stats, 
notice that this build still takes care to put points 
into HP. No matter what the build is, HP is always 
important, and it’s an easy mistake to make to ignore it 
entirely. While this build isn’t as fast as tthe Sweeper or 
as survivable, it can hit just as hard with both Attacking 
Stats, allowing it to more easily take down foes that are 
committed to one Defensive Stat over the other. 
Nature: Naughty (+Attack / -Special Defense)
The aim of this Nature is simple: allow Attacking Stats 
to be raised without limit.
Poké Edges: Mixed Sweeper Rank 1 and 2
Ability Choices: Photosynthesis, Chlorophyll
These Ability choices were made for much the same 
reason as the choices for the Sweeper. Again, another 
Pokémon will have to provide Sunny Day for it.
Moves: Leaf Storm, Sludge Bomb, Earthquake, Outrage, 
Growth, Double-Edge
This Move List is similar to a Sweeper’s but can add Leaf 
Storm without worrying about the self debuff.

A Trainer’s Pokémon does not exist in a vacuum. Their 
Natures, likes, dislikes, and the habits of species do and 
should play a part in how a Trainer interacts with their 
team. Cruel conduct and bitter medicine, even in the 
pursuit of being the best, can have major consequences 
if a Trainer goes overboard.
A Pokémon’s Loyalty is a secret value kept by the GM.
There are 7 Ranks of Loyalty, from 0 to 6, and these 
ranks measure how well the Pokémon listens to you, 
how defiant they may become, or how vulnerable they 
are to being snagged and stolen by illicit parties. The 
Moves Return and Frustration also depend on Loyalty.
Loyalty 0 Pokémon detest their trainers, and defy 
them at every opportunity. You must make a DC 20 
Command Check to give commands to Pokémon with 
0 Loyalty. If you fail, the Pokémon may loaf about doing 
nothing, or may use whichever Move or Attack it pleases 
on whichever target it pleases – including its Trainer or 
other helpless bystanders! 
These Pokémon are usually the product of chronic and 
brutal mistreatment, such as Pokémon kept by a Lasher 
that are never allowed to fully recover from the Injuries 
inflicted by their brutal training or the application of 
Features like Strike of the Whip. It usually takes a special 
effort to lower a Pokémon down to this Loyalty Rank.
However, it’s not unheard of for Pokémon to be caught 
at this Loyalty Rank as well. As an extreme example, a 
Trainer who crushed a mother Pokémon’s nest of eggs 
and then proceeded to capture her would rightfully 
earn the ire of that Pokémon! 
In a more benign case, an especially powerful and feral 
Pokémon that was caught by a stroke of luck could 
begin at Loyalty 0 or even require a higher Command 
Check than 20 to order in battle at first. The Trainer 
would have to prove their worth in order to overcome 
this obstacle. 
The typical behavior of Loyalty 0 Pokémon can vary 
widely, from near-paralyzing fear of their Trainer to 
incredibly active defiance. Either way, it is usually not a 
good idea to leave them unattended or even have them 
released and unrestrained in public, as they may be 
wont to run away or even attack bystanders. 
Loyalty 1 Pokémon similarly dislike their trainer, and 
require a DC 8 Command Check to give Commands 
to in battle.
Their ire for their Trainers is less extreme than the case 
of Loyalty 0 Pokémon. They are often mistreated as well, 
but to a lesser extent. A Trainer who both consistently 
uses Features such as Press and takes no special care to 
ensure their Pokémon enjoy themselves will likely end 
up with a team that resents them. 
Pokémon who feel as if they were caught in an unfair or 
undeserved manner may begin at Loyalty 1, particularly 
if they are Pokémon that tend to have a strong sense of 
honor, such as Gallade. 
It’s not always a Trainer’s fault that a Pokémon is at 
this Loyalty Rank, however. For example, if a Trainer 
rescues a Pokémon from a Team Rocket laboratory or 
the basement of an abusive owner, the Pokémon may 
feel distrust toward them out of an ingrained sense of 
paranoia and fear for all Trainers. 
While not as obviously dangerous as Loyalty 0 Pokémon, 
Loyalty 1 Pokémon will display unruly behavior when 
let out of their Poké Balls and may make small displays 
of defiance such as “accidentally” tripping their Trainer 
as they walk down the street or scaring off wild Pokémon 
that their Trainer is trying to befriend. 
Loyalty 2 Pokémon like their trainer well enough but 
hold no particular fondness for them. 
Most caught wild Pokémon will begin at this Loyalty 
Rank, and it doesn’t take much to maintain this level 
of Loyalty either. As long as a Pokémon is fed well and 
given basic necessities, they will tolerate their Trainer, 
even if they aren’t particularly willing to go out of their 
way for them. 
Even if a Trainer consistently makes use of Features 
such as Press, treating their Pokémon with respect and 
care the rest of the time may keep their Loyalty at this 
rank rather than falling to 1 or 0. 
Loyalty 2 Pokémon generally behave themselves when 
out of their Poké Balls, but they won’t overtly display 
much affection. They will usually follow orders, however, 
and won’t get in the way.
Loyalty

Loyalty 3 Pokémon is the average loyalty for most 
Pokémon – these Pokémon are fond of their trainers 
and respect them to some degree. 
Most Pokémon rise to at least this Loyalty Rank if 
they’re treated relatively well. If a Trainer avoids abusive 
Features and repulsive medicines and otherwise spends 
quality time with their Pokémon, they will attain this 
Loyalty Rank in time. 
It’s also possible for a Pokémon to begin at Loyalty 3. 
For example, most Pokémon hatched from eggs will 
bond easily with their Trainers as a parent figure and 
begin at this Loyalty Rank. Befriending a Pokémon and 
earning its trust rather than beating it up to capture it 
will also often result in a higher starting Loyalty Rank. 
Pokémon of this Loyalty Rank and higher will actively 
pursue playtime or recreation with their Trainers, and 
they will feel disappointed or neglected if ignored or 
left in the Pokémon Storage System for long periods 
of time. Most Trainers, even when they have raised an 
established ‘tournament team’ to battle with, will find 
time to spend with their other Pokémon companions. 
This higher maintenance is not without its benefits, of 
course. Pokémon at Loyalty 3 or higher can attempt 
to Intercept incoming attacks aimed at their Trainers 
in battle (page 242). They will also often take a more 
proactive stance when out of their Poké Balls when it 
comes to searching for useful things or pointing out 
potential dangers to their Trainers. 
Loyalty 4 Pokémon show fondness and respect in more 
generous measures.  
Trainers who make an extra effort – searching out 
foods and Snacks that fit their Pokémon’s preferred 
flavor profiles, taking their Pokémon to a Groomer, 
and spending time indulging their Pokémon’s interests 
outside of battling, for example – will find their Pokémon 
growing to this Loyalty Rank over time. 
Newly acquired Pokémon almost never come at this 
Loyalty Rank or higher. Only special circumstances 
may warrant this. For example, a Trainer inheriting the 
old family Hydreigon after the passing of their Gym 
Leader father. Or a Trainer who earns the deep respect 
of a Venusaur that acts as a forest’s guardian by saving 
the local wildlife from a large expedition of poachers. 
Pokémon behavior at this Loyalty Rank is similar to that 
at Loyalty 3 but taken to a greater degree. 
Loyalty 5 Pokémon are true friends with their Trainers, 
and share a mutual bond of great trust and respect.
At this Loyalty Rank and higher, time is one of the 
biggest factors in determining whether a Pokémon 
reaches these Loyalty Ranks. A Trainer may treat their 
Pokémon phenomenally well, but they must do so over 
the course of many adventures to earn these Loyalty 
Ranks. This time spent together means Loyalty 5 and 6 
Pokémon are very comfortable with their Trainers and 
go out of their way to help and please them. 
Loyalty 6 is a hard to attain rank, reserved for Trainers 
and Pokémon that share a true bond. Loyalty 6 Pokémon 
are often well-treated Starter Pokémon, or Pokémon 
that have been with the Trainer for so many years or 
through so many adventures that they might as well be 
that Trainer’s Starter. 
Pokémon of this Loyalty Rank display an absolute bond 
of trust with their Trainers and are more than willing 
to risk their lives for them – and in most cases, their 
Trainers feel the same way. Pokémon at Loyalty 6 may 
attempt to intercept attacks aimed at any ally in battle. 
Most Pokémon of this Loyalty Rank have gone through 
serious trials and tribulations with their Trainers. While 
it is certainly possible to raise a Pokémon to Loyalty 6 
with a lackadaisical lifestyle, it is much more common 
for Pokémon who’ve met danger head-on many times 
alongside their Trainers to reach this Loyalty Rank. 
They know their Trainers well, may intuitively sense 
when they’re upset, and can see through almost all 
attempts at impersonation.


## Page 212

Changing Loyalty
Ultimately, it is up to the GM to determine when a 
Pokémon’s Loyalty Rank rises or falls. They may give 
you hints about how much a Pokémon loves you but 
are not obligated to tell you a Pokémon’s precise Loyalty 
Rank.
Raising Loyalty is harder at the extremes of the Loyalty 
spectrum, whether low or high. Pokémon with a very 
low Loyalty Rank, such as 0 or 1, have a hard time 
growing to trust a Trainer and are reluctant to establish 
a strong initial bond with them. Many Pokémon at these 
Loyalty Ranks are traumatized or jaded and find it very 
difficult to change their opinions on a Trainer. Good 
treatment, if given only occasionally, may be perceived 
by a wary Pokémon as a trap, and it takes a concerted 
effort over a longer period of time to build up trust that 
was lost through abusive behavior.
In the case of low Loyalty resulting from a Pokémon 
feeling as if it were undeservedly captured, no amount 
of good treatment will raise their Loyalty Rank on 
its own. For these Pokémon, their Trainers must 
prove themselves to be worthy of commanding them, 
and nothing less will earn their endearment. For 
many Pokémon in this category, this simply means 
demonstrating battling prowess, which is most easily 
done through Gym Challenges. For other Pokémon 
which display a strong code of conduct or sense of 
honor, then living up to their ethical standards might 
be the key for their Trainers. 
On the other side of the spectrum, it is difficult to get a 
Pokémon from Loyalty 4 up to Loyalty 6, largely because 
so much of that is dependent on time and opportunity 
to display strong bonds of trust. 
For both of these cases, it is often a good idea for GMs to 
construct a quest of sorts that embodies what’s needed 
for a rise in Loyalty, once the time is right. A Trainer 
struggling to earn the trust of a Pokémon they rescued 
from a lab that performed horrible experiments on 
its test subjects might be given an opportunity to take 
down another similar lab alongside their Pokémon. A 
Trainer who’s journeyed with their Starter for a long 
time may finally take them on a trip to see a special 
location to that Pokémon or take on and defeat a long-
standing rival who has been difficult for the two of them 
to overcome in previous battles.
As a consequence, this does mean a GM has to start 
thinking more about a Pokémon’s personality, desires, 
and general interests as they grow closer to their Trainer. 
This is very important! Ideally, a Pokémon would give 
regular indications of what it wants in order to guide a 
Trainer along the path of raising their Loyalty. 
Loyalty changes around the values of 2 to 4 are much 
simpler, in comparison. Regular good treatment will 
lead naturally to increases in Loyalty as a Pokémon 
spends more time with their Trainer while persistent 
use of Repulsive Medicines, Moves like Explosion, 
and Features like Press will lower Loyalty over time. 
Particularly extreme events, such as deliberately 
endangering a Pokémon’s offspring or risking life and 
limb to reunite a Pokémon with lost family will result in 
quicker and more pronounced increases or decreases in 
Loyalty Rank, of course.

Breeding Pokémon
When prompted by a Trainer with the Breeder Edge, 
or perhaps due to divine (GM) intervention, your 
Pokémon may decide to breed and produce an egg.
When an egg is produced, roll 1d20 to determine the 
species of the egg. If the roll is 5 or higher, the egg is of 
the female’s species. If the roll is 4 or lower, the egg is of 
the male’s species.
Consult the Egg Move List of the Child’s Pokémon 
Species. Note down any Moves on the Egg Move List 
known by either Parent, or any Moves known by either 
parent that the Child can learn via TM. This is the 
Pokémon’s Inheritance Move List. 
At Level 20 and every 10 Levels thereafter, the Child 
Pokémon can learn a Move from its Inheritance Move 
List, as if it was learning it via Level-Up. 
Nature, Ability , and Gender are decided based on 
the Breeder’s Pokémon Education Rank. If their Rank 
is high enough, they are allowed to choose. If it’s not, 
these are decided by the GM, or randomly generated – 
as your GM prefers.
Nature may be determined at random easily by rolling 
2d6; the first d6 represents the Stat raised, the second 
represents the Stat lowered. If the same Stat is lowered 
and raised, this results in a Neutral Nature. May be 
picked by Breeders with a Pokémon Education Rank 
of Adept or higher.
Ability is decided from the species’ basic Abilities. May 
be decided by Breeders with a Pokémon Education 
Rank of Expert or higher.
Gender may be determined at random by rolling 100 
and checking its Gender Balance; see what percent of 
the Pokémon are female. If the number rolled is lower 
than or matches that number, the Pokémon is Female; 
otherwise, it is Male. May be picked by Breeders with a 
Pokémon Education Rank of Master.
When the egg hatches, roll 1d100 to see if the Pokémon 
is Shiny; on a roll of either 1 or 100, the Pokémon is 
special in some way, determined by your GM. See 
Chapter 10: Running the Game for more details on 
‘Shiny’ Pokémon (page 467).
GM Tip: Though eggs have explicit in-game hatch rates, consider cutting down these hatch rates a bit occasionally, 
especially if you often spend a very long time on every day. Unless an egg is particularly mysterious, 3 sessions is 
probably long enough of a wait no matter how much time has passed in-character. Exceptions apply, of course.
Optional Rule: Baby Template 
You may wish to roleplay baby Pokémon has having a small handicap, due to their newborn status. 
If so, simply subtract 2, 3, or even 4 from each of the Pokémon’s Base Stats, lower each of their Skills one Rank, and 
lower their Capabilities by 2. Weight and height are lowered accordingly, by up to 50%. 
Pokémon tend to grow quickly; every 5 levels, they gain +1 to each of their Base Stats, and they grow in size a little. 
When they have finally regained all of their Base Stats, remove the penalties to skills and capabilities.
This template isn’t necessary for Pokémon that are already quite weak; a baby Sentret probably doesn’t need this 
applied, for example, and don’t even consider it on a Weedle.  If your Trainers somehow gain a baby Pinsir or 
Tauros early on, you may wish to dampen those Stats however. 
You can also use this Template to make Legendary Pokémon usable by PCs! You could even make it permanent or 
partly permanent, especially on Pokémon with a Base Stat Total of over 60 or so.

Capturing Pokémon
Typically, Capturing Pokémon is a two-step process 
requiring some Poké Balls.
Poké Balls can be thrown as a Standard Action, as an 
AC6 Status Attack Roll, with a range equal to 4 plus 
your Athletics Rank. 
Poké Balls that fail to hit their target land on the terrain 
behind the target Pokémon harmlessly, and will usually 
land without breaking. 
If you roll a Natural 20 on this Accuracy Check, subtract 
-10 from the Capture Roll. 
Once the Poké Ball hits, you must roll the Capture Roll. 
Roll 1d100, and subtract the Trainer’s Level, and any 
modifiers from equipment or Features.
If you roll under or equal to the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate, the Pokémon is Captured! A natural roll of 100 
always captures the target without fail.
Calculating Capture Rates
A Pokémon’s Capture Rate depends on its Level, Hit Points, Status Afflictions, Evolutionary Stage, and Rarity. 
First, begin with 100.  Then subtract the Pokémon’s Level x2.  
Next, look at the Pokémon’s current Hit Points. If the Pokémon is above 75% Hit Points, subtract 30 from the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate. If the Pokémon is at 75% Hit Points or lower, subtract 15 from the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate.  If the Pokémon is at 50% or lower, the Capture Rate is unmodified. If the Pokémon is at 25% Hit Points or 
lower, add a total of +15 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  And if the Pokémon is at exactly 1 Hit Point, add a total 
of +30 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Pokémon reduced to 0 Hit Points or less cannot be captured. Poké Balls will 
simply fail to attempt to energize them. 
Next, look at the Pokémon’s Evolutionary Stage.  If the Pokémon has two evolutions remaining, add +10 to the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  If the Pokémon has one evolution remaining, don’t change the Capture Rate. If the 
Pokémon has no evolutions remaining, subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
Next, consider the Pokémon’s Rarity. Shiny Pokémon subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Legendary 
Pokémon subtract 30 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
And last, consider any Status Afflictions and Injuries. Persistent Conditions add +10 to the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate; Injuries and Volatile Conditions add +5. Additionally, Stuck adds +10 to Capture Rate, and Slow adds +5.
Got all that? Let’s see a few examples so you can be sure.
A level 10 Pikachu that is at 70% Hit Points and Confused would have a Capture Rate of 70.
Math: Level (+80), Health (-15), One Evolution (+0), Confused (+5)
A Shiny level 30 Caterpie that is at 40% Hit Points and has one injury would have a Capture Rate of 45.
Math: Level (+40), Health (+0), Two Evolutions (+10), Shiny (-10), Injury (+5). 
A level 80 Hydreigon that is at exactly 1 Hit Point, and is Burned, Poisoned, and has one Injury would have a 
Capture Rate of -15.
Math: Level (-60), Health (+30), No Evolutions (-10), Burned (+10), Poisoned (+10), Injury (+5).
Doxy: GMs should of course feel free to make adjustments to a Pokémon’s Capture Rate. If a Pokémon WANTS to 
be caught, the Capture shouldn’t fail, for example. Or if a Pokémon is simply way too powerful compared 
to average level of Pokémon held by PCs, the roll may fail even when it otherwise might not. If a species 
is particularly rare or common in your setting, you may create your own Rarity modifier.

Pokémon Disposition
Not all encounters with Wild Pokémon have to end in 
battle. Trainers may choose to help them out, befriend 
them, or seek their aid without capturing them. Pokémon 
can be tricky and difficult to predict, but as with most 
things in life, being friendly and open generally helps 
when trying to avoid hostile interactions.
Wild Pokémon have 6 different Dispositions towards 
Trainers or a group of Trainers, ranging from Very 
Friendly to Very Hostile. 
Very Friendly or Friendly Pokémon will try to interact 
with trainers. Neutral Pokémon will likely just continue 
about their business, either ignoring or casually 
observing the Trainers. Fearful Pokémon will be very 
wary of nearby trainers, or may try to run away or hide. 
Hostile or Very Hostile Pokémon will likely stand their 
ground stubbornly against any incursions, try to run 
the trainers off, or outright attack them.
The vast majority of Wild Pokémon will begin at 
Neutral, Fearful, or Hostile towards random Trainers in 
their territory. Helping Wild Pokémon with problems or 
bribing them with food may improve their disposition, 
to the GM’s discretion. If Pokémon are made Friendly or 
Very Friendly, they may even ask to be caught without 
a fight, but not always. Attacking Pokémon or attacking 
their friends or family will likely ruin a Pokémon’s 
disposition towards you. Some acts may be enough 
to go from Neutral straight to Very Hostile with little 
chance of redemption – hurting or killing a Pokémon’s 
baby, for example.
As a Standard Action, Trainers may make a Charm 
Check to try to improve a Wild Pokémon’s Disposition 
one step; Very Hostile to Hostile, Hostile to Neutral, 
Fearful to Neutral, Neutral to Friendly, and Friendly to 
Very Friendly. The DC of the Charm Check depends on 
the initial disposition of the Pokémon. If you fail, you 
cannot try again to improve your disposition through 
a Charm check, but other actions such as providing 
food or helping the Pokémon out may raise disposition 
automatically or at least let you try again, to your GM’s 
discretion.

Pokémon Fossils
Fossils are calcified imprints of a long dead Pokémon 
that still contain a bit of Pokémon DNA.  
Omanyte, 
Kabuto, 
Aerodactyl, 
Lileep, 
Anorith, 
Cranidos, Shieldon, Tirtouga, Archen, Amaura, and 
Tyrunt can often only be found as fossils, but that 
doesn’t mean Fossils of other Pokémon don’t exist. 
Rock Type, Water Type, Bug Type, and Grass Type 
Pokémon make especially apt fossils, or this may be a 
good opportunity to give a PC a Rock-Shifted Pokémon!
A Trainer with the Paleontologist Edge can use a 
Reanimation Machine or Portable Reanimation 
Machine to create an Egg from a viable Fossil. The Egg 
is hatched at Level 10 unlike normal eggs.
If they succeed, an Egg of the Pokémon is created with 
Gender, Nature, Abilities, Moves and such determined 
by the GM. Like a normal Wild Pokémon, this Pokémon 
has the potential to be Shiny. The GM may also decide 
to give the newly hatched Pokémon an Inheritance 
Move List. 
GM TIP: Finding Fossils – Giving a PC a Fossil is a great way to create an exciting moment in-game! You can have 
your PCs stumble upon these fossils in a cave, or have them be gifts from a friendly NPC. You probably don’t need 
to do this more than once per game for most PCs.
However, some players may want to pursue Fossils more actively for thematic or character reasons; this should by 
all means be encouraged! If so, you may want to plant a few “Fossil Quarries” throughout your campaign setting. 
Here, PCs can spend an afternoon digging and searching to make a Pokémon Education or Survival Check to 
search for fossils. Even those Untrained in these Skills can usually find some useful items here: Shards, Evolutionary 
Stones, or other items. Those trained in the Skills will have an easier time finding these items.
Those with at least Adept Pokémon Education or Survival or the Paleontologist Edge are capable of finding real 
fossils though! The DC to find any items is to your discretion, but here are some ideas and guidelines for Fossils: 
Easy (DC 15): Searching for Fossils in an undisturbed dried out lake bed. Fossils in the area are usually intact 
enough for revival and well-preserved by having fallen into prehistoric tar pits or similar areas. Fossil hunting 
areas will usually only fall into this category if they’re out of the way and not often visited.
Moderate (DC 18): Searching for Fossils embedded in shale on a cliff side or right inside a cave. Public Fossil 
Quarries usually fall into this category, as all of the easy pickings have already been found but enough remain to 
entice visitors. 
Hard (DC 25): Searching for Fossils in heavily disturbed areas or where few factors exist to promote preservation 
of Fossil matter. Numerous factors such as seismic activity or nearby human civilization can make whole Fossils 
difficult to find in these areas. Trainers may have to find multiple pieces of a Fossil and reassemble them before 
revival is possible. 
It’s not always possible to find Fossils in a given area, not even at the Hard DC given above! The vast majority of 
caves and lake beds will have nothing in the way of recoverable Fossils, which makes the areas that do have Fossils 
to be found that much more special.

Fishing
Fishing is always a relaxing way to spend the afternoon. 
With a good fishing rod and some bait or a lure, it’s an 
easy way to catch some Water-Type Pokémon.
What you can fish up depends on your Fishing Rod. 
There are  three types of rods: Old Rods, Good Rods, 
and Super Rods.
Old Rods are capable only of fishing up small, 
unevolved Pokémon at level 10 or under. Good Rods 
may catch unevolved Pokémon of a Level to your GM’s 
discretion. Super Rods may catch Pokémon of any size 
and evolutionary stage, to your GM’s discretion.
To fish, you must attach Bait or a Fishing Lure to the 
end of your rope, then cast your line.  Roll 1d20 every 
5 minutes. If you roll 15 or over, a Wild Pokémon is on 
the line! If you roll 3 times without success, the bait is 
used up – lures may continue to be used though.
Then you must make an Athletics Check with a DC 
of 8. If you succeed, you manage to reel the Pokémon 
in. From there, you may try to catch the Pokémon in a 
Hand Net, or a Poké Ball. The Pokémon may attempt 
to attack you or your allies, so it’s usually smart to keep 
a Pokémon handy when fishing.
If you fail your Athletics Check, roll 1d20. On a result of 
10 or lower, the Pokémon got away with your Lure. Bait 
is always lost upon a failed Athletics Check.
GM TIPS: Here’s a handy list of unevolved Pokémon that are commonly found in Fresh or Salt Water via fishing. 
Feel free to add or remove Pokémon, based on your current location. Whether you choose the Pokémon that are 
fished or roll randomly is up to you!
Fresh Water: Poliwag, Shellder, Goldeen, Magikarp, Carvanha, Barboach, Corphish, Finneon, Tympole, Basculin
Salt Water: Tentacool, Shellder, Krabby, Horsea, Staryu, Magikarp, Remoraid, Carvanha, Feebas, Luvdisc, Shellos, 
Finneon, Frillish, Skrelp, Clauncher

Pokémon as Mounts
Riding certain Pokémon might seem intuitive; Ponyta 
are obviously built for it! Others, not so much. We 
have included a Mountable Capability to mark some 
Pokémon that may be mountable. However, Mountable 
is a suggestion and not a hard and fast rule. Ultimately, 
whether a Pokémon can serve as a mount or not is up to 
your GM, so here are some things to consider for GMs 
who wish to consider other options.
1.	 Size. If a Pokémon is too small, it wouldn’t make 
sense for a trainer to be riding it, when their legs are 
dragging on the ground. This could be confusing 
for certain species of Pokémon, but a quick look 
at the Pokémon’s Level should serve as a hint as to 
whether or not the Pokémon is too small for you. 
For example, a Ponyta around Level 20 or 25, can 
serve as a mount. Ponyta may not be very tall, but it 
can support an average sized human considering its 
shape and its legs that are built to lift itself with little 
burden and quickly move around. However, a newly 
born Ponyta should not be able to lift a person. It 
would be very tiny. Another example would be an 
Onix. Onix could easy serve as an entire party’s 
Mount. However, a newly born Onix would not be 
able to serve as even one person’s Mount as it would 
probably be no longer than a meter. Also consider 
that the size listed in the Pokédex is the average size 
for a species. Particularly old specimens or special 
ones your GM creates may be much larger and more 
easily used as transportation.
2.	 Power. If a Pokémon is large, but is as light as a 
feather or weak as a twig, it probably cannot carry 
your weight and keep itself up as well. This would 
be most obvious for a Sky Mount. If the Pokémon’s 
Power is one or two, there should be no circumstance 
in which the Pokémon would be able to carry your 
weight on their body.
3.	 Equipment. Some Pokémon might not ever be able 
to be a Mount, by itself. However, with a couple of 
Pokémon, such as a Nidorino and a Nidorina, some 
rope to use as reigns, a sled and some training, you 
could have a single mount between the two Pokémon. 
A school of Magikarp could hold a mattress up and 
make a raft. Several creative combinations of tools 
and Pokémon could create modes of transportation.
Using Mounts in Battle
»»
Mounting a Pokémon is a Standard Action with an 
Acrobatics or Athletics Check with a DC of 10. 
»»
If your Acrobatics or Athletics is at least Expert, 
then you may Mount your Pokémon as part of your 
Shift as a Free Action, so long as you can move at 
least 2 meters before getting onto your Pokémon.
»»
Pokémon take any penalties from carrying Heavy 
or Staggering weight as normal.
»»
When mounted on a Pokémon, you may Shift during 
your Trainer turn using your Mount’s Movement 
Capabilities instead of your own. During Pokémon 
turns, your Mount may use any unused movement 
to Shift, and may take a Standard Action as normal 
if you use your Pokémon turn on it.
»»
If either you or your Pokémon who is being used 
as a Mount are hit by a damaging attack that deals 
damage equal or greater to 1/4th of the target’s Max 
Hit Points, or are hit by a move with a Push Effect, 
you must make an Acrobatics or Athletics Check 
with a DC of 10 to remain mounted.
»»
If a rider’s mount hurts itself in Confusion, the rider 
must make an Acrobatics or Athletics Check with a 
DC of 10 to remain mounted.
»»
You may use your Mount to Shift on your turn 
while using your Pokémon turn to order another 
Pokémon in battle.
»»
It is very easy for you and your Pokémon to Intercept 
attacks for each other while you are Mounted due to 
the lack of distance. See page 242 for details on the 
Intercept Maneuvers.
