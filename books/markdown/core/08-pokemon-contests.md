Chapter 8:  
Pokémon Contests
An Introduction to Contests
Pokémon Contests are an alternate non-violent form of sport and competition that many Trainers choose to 
participate in. These Trainers are often called Coordinators, and the Trainer Class of the same name is built to 
specialize in Pokémon Contests. Contests are conducted in front of an audience and a panel of judges who the 
contestants try to impress by having their Pokémon use their Moves in dazzling performances. 
The Contest Circuit
Similar to Pokémon Gyms, many cities have Contest 
Halls where Trainers gather to compete in Pokémon 
Contests. And similar to how Gyms often specialize in 
a Pokémon Type, a particular Contest Hall may cater 
to a specific Contest Type – either Beauty, Cool, Cute, 
Smart, or Tough. Many Contest Halls, however, host 
Contests of all Types. 
Winning a Contest rewards a Trainer with a Ribbon, and 
a Ribbon from a prestigious Contest Hall often carries 
the same weight as a Gym Badge in demonstrating a 
Trainer’s prowess and skill. Many Gym Leaders are 
themselves famous Coordinators as well.
Like Gyms, Contest Halls are organized into a Contest 
Circuit, and there are often large events called Grand 
Festivals similar to a Pokémon League tournament that 
require a certain number of Ribbons, usually five, for a 
Trainer to qualify to compete. 
Differences With Battling
Much like in Pokémon Battles, a Pokémon’s Moves 
are their main tools in Pokémon Contests. Unlike in 
battles,  however, Pokémon competing in a Contest do 
not aim to fight each other (except perhaps in certain 
non-traditional Contest formats!) but instead use their 
Moves to put on a show, such as creating fireworks with 
Fire-Type Moves. 
Preparing a Pokémon for a Contest is usually quite 
different from preparing them for battling. Some 
Moves that may not add much to a Pokémon’s battling 
arsenal may complement its other Moves in Contest 
Effects very well. Where battlers often seek Vitamins to 
improve their Pokémon’s Base Stats, Coordinators look 
for Poffins to improve Contest Stats. 
It may be worthwhile in campaigns where Contests are 
prominent for a Trainer to raise Pokémon specifically 
for these competitions separate from their battling team.

Contest Stats
Pokémon Contests have their own set of Stats; Cool, 
Tough, Beauty, Smart, and Cute.  These Stats are 
used to power up a Pokémon’s Moves during Contests. 
Instead of with flat values, these Stats are calculated in 
Dice; always a certain number of D6.
The five Contest Stats correlate directly to five of the 
Combat Stats; Attack to Cool, Defense to Tough, 
Special Attack to Beauty, Special Defense to Smart, and 
Speed to Cute. And just like the Stat Ace specializes in 
a Combat Stat, the Style Expert specializes in different 
Contest Stats.
In addition, each Contest Stat is roughly associated 
with a few Types. This doesn’t mean every Move in the 
associated Type will match up with the Contest Stat, but 
usually a large proportion of Moves do line up. Some 
Types are associated with multiple Contest Stats and 
some more spread out throughout all the different Stats. 
Beauty is often associated with the Fire, Ice, and Water 
Types. Cool is often associated with the Dragon, 
Electric, Fighting, and Flying Types. Cute is associated 
with the Fairy, Normal, Psychic, and Water Types. Smart 
is associated with the Grass, Ghost, Poison, and Psychic 
Types. Tough is associated with the Fighting, Ground, 
Normal and Rock Types. 
Each Contest Stat has two Allied Stats and two 
Opposing Stats. In the following chart, each Contest 
Stat is allied with its adjacent Stats and opposed to the 
other two. These will factor into Contests that are tied 
to a specific Contest Stat. The most common Contest 
Variant has one Contest Type the entire time.
Pokémon can gain Contest Stats in two main ways: 
through their Combat Stats and through eating Poffins.
For every 10 Points of the matching Combat Stat, a 
Pokémon has +1 Contest Die in the correlating Contest 
Stat, up to a maximum of 3 at 30. Combat Stages are 
never taken into account.
Contest Stats can also be gained from Poffins! Pokémon 
may consume 1 Poffin, plus one more for every 5 levels 
they gain, up to a maximum of 6 total Poffins at level 25. 
Poffins each raise one Contest Stat by +1 Dice. Additional 
Poffins past the maximum of 6 have no effect. 
To use your hard earned Contest Stats, when you use a 
Move of the appropriate Contest Stat, you may use up 
to 3 of your Contest Dice in that Stat to add the same 
amount of d6 to an Appeal Roll. Once those Dice are 
used, they may not be used again in that Contest.
For example, if you have a Cool Stat of 4d6, when you 
use a Cool Move you may add up to 3d6 to the appeal 
Roll. On the following round, if you use a Cool Move 
again, you may add a maximum of 1d6 since you already 
used 3d6 of your Cool Stat dice. It’s important to time 
your extra dice when you think you’ll be able to get the 
most use out of them!

Playing a Pokémon Contest
The first step to playing a Pokémon Contest is to figure 
out what Contest Variant is being used. There are three 
main Contest Variants, though you should feel free 
to come up with your own ideas! All of these Contest 
Variants operate with the standard Contest mechanics 
and involve only Pokémon as performers. At the end 
of the basic Contest rules, we’ll provide you with a few 
non-traditional Contest Variants as well which throw in 
twists such as direct Trainer involvement, integration 
with battles, and other nifty ideas! 
Standard Contest: A Standard Contest picks one 
Contest Stat – Cool, Cute, Tough, Beauty, or Smart 
– to have as its Contest Type the entire time. Usually 
these Contests are advertised as ‘Cool Contests’ or ‘Cute 
Contests’ so that participants may prepare do their best 
in that particular Contest Stat.
Supercontest: Supercontests are a simple and fun 
variant of Standard Contests; instead of having one pre-
determined type, at the beginning of each round the 
GM randomly decides which Type will be the dominant 
Type for that Round. Simply roll 1d6; 1 is Cool, 2 is 
Tough, 3 is Beauty, 4 is Smart, and 5 is Cute. Re-roll on 
a 6.
Festival: A Festival is a very intense contest with 
many rounds more than usual!  Simply play them 
like a Standard Contest or Super Contest until the 
end – subtract Fumble from Appeal as usual, then, 
the participant with the lowest amount of Appeal is 
eliminated, and the Contest starts from the beginning 
with one less participant!  Appeal carries over between 
each ‘Contest’.  When there’s only Three contestants left, 
the Contestant with the most Appeal Points at the end 
of that Contest is the winner!
When you’ve determined what Contest Variant is being 
used, and you’ve made your preparations, it’s time to 
begin the Contest! Contests occur in two stages: the 
Introduction Stage and the Performance Stage.
Introduction Stage
In the Introduction Stage, a Pokémon is sent out and 
the Trainer introduces themselves and the Pokémon to 
the audience! Each Trainer chooses Charm, Command, 
Guile, Intimidate, or Intuition. Roll 1d6 for each rank 
of the chosen Skill the Trainer has. For each die that 
comes up a result of 3, 4, 5, or 6, the Trainer gains 
one die in a Contest Stat that may be used during this 
Contest just like a Pokémon’s Contest Stat Dice.  Charm 
rolls generate Cute Dice, Command rolls generate 
Cool Dice, Guile rolls generate Smart Dice,  Intimidate 
rolls generate Tough Dice, and Intuition rolls generate 
Beauty Dice. Trainers who make a roll using the Skill 
matching the Contest Stat of a Standard Contest begin 
the Contest with two bonus Appeal Points. 
Experienced Trainers also make use of Held Items and 
Grooming that allow them to make additional rolls to 
generate more Contest Stat Dice in the same manner, 
with one die being generated per result of 3, 4, 5, or 6. 
These bonus rolls do not have to match the 
Contest Type of their chosen Skill.

Appeal Points
The Winner of the Contest is determined by who has 
the most Appeal Points. In Contests, you have two 
different Stages in which to earn Appeal Points; the 
Introduction Stage, the Performance Stage.
During each stage, you will be rolling many d6 to try 
and earn Appeal Points. 
»»
Whenever you roll a 1, you gain 0 Appeal Points for 
that roll.
»»
Whenever you roll 2, 3, 4, or 5, you gain 1 Appeal 
Point for that roll.
»»
Whenever you roll a 6, you gain 2 Appeal Points for 
that roll!
This is the general rule, but this changes when you are 
the Center of Attention.
Once per contest, each Pokémon will be in the middle 
of the stage, and will be the Center of Attention.  This 
round is important because it offers a chance for 
many points – but also failure. If you are the Center of 
Attention, score points as follows instead.
»»
Whenever you roll a 6, you gain +3 Appeal Points.
»»
Whenever you roll a 5 or 4, you gain +2 Appeal 
Points.
»»
Whenever you roll a 3, you gain +1 Appeal Point.
»»
Whenever you roll a 2, you gain 0 Appeal Points.
»»
Whenever you roll a 1, you gain 0 Appeal Points and 
gain 1 Fumble Point.
Fumble Points are negative Points; at the end of a 
Contest, you subtract any Fumble Points from your 
Total Appeal.
Voltage
There’s one more thing to keep track of during Contests 
– Voltage.  Voltage represents how much attention each 
participant is drawing from the audience. Manipulating 
Voltage is important to winning Contests
Each Participant has a “Voltage” Meter, which starts at 
0 and gets to a maximum of 5.  Voltage is raised and 
lowered by Moves throughout the Contest.
For each point of Voltage at the Start of the Turn, 
Contestants gain +1d6 to their Move that turn. 
Performance Stage
The Performance Stage is the main part of a Contest, 
and takes place over a number of rounds equal to the 
number of contestants. When the Performance Stage 
is finished, Fumble Points are subtracted from Appeal 
Points, and the contestant with the most Appeal points 
is the winner!
At the beginning of the Performance Stage, each 
Participant is assigned a letter (A to E if there’s 5 
participants; simply adjust letters to the number of 
participants).  These letters are retained for the entire 
duration of the Contest. Letters are assigned based on 
the number of total Contest Stat Dice gained at the 
Introduction Stage, from highest to lowest. If a Trainer 
rolled a Skill matching the Contest Stat in a Standard 
Contest, add two to their total for the purposes of 
assigning letters. If there is a tie, simply flip a coin.
During each round of the Performance Stage, each 
Pokémon performs a Move from their Move list, and 
uses its Contest Effect to gain Appeal Points. You may 
not use the same Move twice in a row during a Contest.
You do not need to pay attention to the normal battling 
frequencies for Moves as your Pokémon is using them 
for performance instead of seriously executing the 
attacks.
Moves are declared in turn order, which is specified on 
the next page, based on the Position of the Contestants. 
Moves may affect only Pokémon adjacent to them that 
turn.
If a Move matches the Contest Type of the Contest, 
the Move rolls an additional 1d6. If the Move is of an 
opposing Type, it rolls one less 1d6 (or gain a Fumble 
Point if the Move would roll no dice). If the Move is of 
an allied type, no changes are made. 
For example, in a Cool Contest, using a Smart or Cute 
Move will cause you to roll one less die; if you are rolling 
no dice, you instead gain a Fumble Point. Using a Tough 
or Beauty Move will not affect your roll. Using a Cool 
Move will add +1 die.

Turn Order and Position
Turn Order and Position are very important tactical 
information during Contests. Turn Order is determined 
by Position.
Remember those Letters assigned to Participants at the 
beginning of the Performance Stage? Those are used to 
determine Position.  The charts below show positions 
for 5, 4, and 3 Person Contests each round.
Each round, simply line the Contestants up, and place 
them in the spot that matches their letter.
Position is important because you can only affect 
Pokémon adjacent to you each round. During a Contest, 
a Pokémon is adjacent to each other participant exactly 
twice, regardless of the number of participants.
Position is also important, because when you are in the 
position with the yellow column below, you are at the 
Center of Attention. See the Appeal Points section for 
more details on being in the Center of Attention.
Turn Order is determined by Position; see the charts 
to the right. The top row designates which contestant 
goes first, then second, etc.  For example, in the first 
round of a 5-person Contest, Contestant A goes first, 
then Contestant B, then Contestant C, then Contestant 
D, then Contestant E.  On the second round, Contestant 
B goes first, then Contestant E, then Contestant D, then 
Contestant A, then Contestant C.

Contest Experience
Contests are demanding experiences, and grant Experience much like Battles! Grant a Pokémon Experience as if 
they had defeated X Pokémon of their own Level, where X is half of the Pokémon they beat in the Contest, rounded 
up. Note that this is an exception to the usual round down rule! Use a relatively low Significance Multiplier; 
perhaps x1.5 or 2. You could go higher if Contests are relatively rare occurrences in your campaign, or if they’re 
very common occurrences in your campaign and this is a particularly decisive Contest for a Contestant’s career! If 
you run a Festival, calculate Experience for the total event, not each sub-contest.
For example, if a Level 10 Pokémon comes in 1st Place in a 5 Person Contest, and the GM uses a significance 
multiplier of x2, they would gain 60 Experience! If they came in last place, they would still gain 20 Experience.

Here’s a quick three participant Contest to show you how they run! To the right, you’ll see the Position and Turn 
chart for such a Contest. 
Let’s meet our contestants: 
Aren’t they cute? Well, they had better hope to be, because this demo will be a standard Cute Contest! 
The Contest begins with the Introduction Stage, where the Trainers 
for each of our contestants roll to determine how many extra Contest 
Stat Dice they’ll have to work with during the Contest. Each of the 
Trainers for the Zubat, Lickitung, and Mawile choose to roll for Cute 
Dice. This would normally be a Charm roll for each of them, but the 
Mawile’s Trainer has Grace and is able to use multiple Skills to roll for 
each Contest Type. They choose to roll Guile. 
The Lickitung’s Trainer has Expert Charm while the Zubat’s has 
Adept Charm and the Mawile’s Adept Guile. They roll [5,1,3,4,4], 
[4,3,1,6], and [2,5,6,2] respectively. This nets them 4, 3, and 2 Cute 
Dice, meaning Lickitung is assigned to letter A, Zubat to letter B, and 
Mawile to letter C. The turn order and positions for the contest are 
displayed in the table on the right. 
Round One: The Lickitung goes first and gives the audience a flirtacious wink as it uses Attract! The Excitement 
Contest Effect increases their Voltage by +2, and they roll a 3d6 for their Appeal, increased to 4d6 for matching 
the Cute Contest Type. They roll [3,2,6,1], and because they’re in the Center of Attention, they gain 1 Appeal 
Point for the 3, 0 Appeal Points for the 2, a whopping 3 Appeal Points for the 6, and a Fumble Point for the 1. 
The Zubat goes next, using U-Turn, doing a somersault in the air! This has the Inversed Appeal Contest Effect, 
allowing the Zubat to roll 5d6 + 1d6 for the Contest Type. They roll [6,1,2,1,5,1]. They gain a total of 4 Appeal from 
this. 
The Mawile takes their turn last in the Contest and opens up their maw to release a pleasant aroma into the 
Contest Hall. Sweet Scent! They spend 2 Cute Dice on the Appeal roll, hoping to catch up with the others, and roll 
5d6 and gain 2 Voltage, for [2,2,6,4,1], also a total of 4 Appeal.
At the end of the first round, everyone is tied at 4 Appeal Points, though the Lickitung and Mawile have 2 Voltage, 
and the Lickitung has 1 Fumble Point. 
Round Two: The Zubat doesn’t like the fact the others around it are gaining Voltage! It opens its mouth wide and 
shoots out a ray of disorienting light. Confuse Ray! It has the Unsettling Contest Effect, meaning each competitor 
adjacent to Zubat – in this case both Lickitung and Mawile – lose 1 Voltage, while the Zubat loses 2. Already at zero 
Voltage, the Zubat doesn’t mind this at all. The Zubat’s Trainer has fed it Poffins, giving it 3 Smart Dice, which it 
proceeds to spend on this Appeal, rolling a total of 8d6! The risky move results in a roll of [1,1,4,6,5,1,6,2]. This is 
a whopping 10 Appeal for Zubat, but also 3 Fumble Points. 
Mawile goes next, and aiming to recover and further increase its Voltage, it sheds Fake Tears for the crowd, 
another Excitement Move. Why not Sweet Scent again? Because in a Contest, you cannot repeat the same Move 
two turns in a row. Its Voltage increases by +2 again, and it rolls 3d6 for Fake Tears, plus another 1d6 for its one 
Voltage at the beginning of its turn. [6,6,3,5] is the result, netting Mawile 6 Appeal Points!

Finally, Lickitung has its turn this round and it opts to swish its tail with a splash of water. Aqua Tail! This Move 
has the Steady Performance Effect, meaning its base dice roll is 5d6, and it increases Lickitung’s Voltage by +1. 
Lickitung chooses to spend 3 of its Cute Dice on increasing its roll, rolling a total of 10d6 from that, Voltage, and 
the bonus for matching the Contest Type. It rolls [1,5,3,3,4,6,6,5,3,5], getting a huge 11 Appeal Points. 
At the end of Round Two, Lickitung leads the pack with 15 Appeal Points, 2 Voltage, and 1 Fumble Point. The 
Zubat has 14 Appeal Points, 0 Voltage, and 3 Fumble Points. Mawile has only 10 Appeal Points but 3 Voltage. 
Round Three: This round, it’s Mawile’s turn to go first! Desperate to recover and make use of their Voltage, it goes 
on a rampage on stage with a Giga Impact! Its Voltage gets set to 0 by the Seen Nothing Yet Contest Effect, but 
they roll 2d6 for each Voltage lost this way, for a total of 6d6. They also do get to add their Voltage bonus for the 
turn regardless, and their Trainer has bed them Poffins for two Beauty Dice. Their final roll is 11d6, and they’re in 
the Center of Attention! The result is [2,5,1,2,4,5,3,2,2,1,4], which is terrible news for Mawile. However, its Trainer 
has the Coordinator Class Feature, which allows them to re-roll one Appeal Roll each Contest! They spend it here, 
and the new result is [3,4,5,4,1,5,6,4,1,6,2], which adds up to 17 Appeal Points and 2 Fumble Points! Will this be 
enough to bring them back from last place? It’s all up to the other competitors now. 
Lickitung goes next and decides to go for disrupting the Mawile instead of gaining more Appeal. They’re not sure 
they can beat that Appeal, but they can sure cut it down some! It curls up and rolls around the stage, getting in the way 
of the other contestants. Defense Curl! This Move has the Sabotage Effect, meaning it gives adjacent competitors 
Fumble Points instead of gaining Appeal. They spend three Cute Dice, one of them from the Introduction Stage 
and two of them from their Speed Stat, and roll a total of 9d6, counting their Voltage and matching the Cute 
Contest. The roll is [5,3,1,3,5,1,3,6,6], which means Mawile gains 9 Fumble Points. Ouch! 
Zubat has the last word in this Contest and flits about in Frustration. This Move has the Desperation Effect, 
which means all 1s result in a Fumble Point, but all 6s reward an extra Appeal Point! They spend their 3 Cute Dice 
on this turn, making their total roll 9d6. They get rather lucky, with a roll of [5,6,4,6,6,4,3,1,3], netting them 14 
Appeal Points and only 1 Fumble Point to show for it. 
The GM tallies up the final score for each Contestant. Lickitung had 15 Appeal Points but 1 Fumble Point, giving 
them a final score of 14! Mawile had 27 Appeal Points but 9 Fumble Points, giving them a score of 16! Zubat had 28 
Appeal Points and 4 Fumble Points, giving them a final score of 24. If Lickitung hadn’t Sabotaged Mawile’s efforts, 
they would have won, but instead Zubat emerges victorious in the Contest! The GM calculates and distributes 
Experience Points to everyone involved, and the Zubat’s Trainer walks away with a new Contest Ribbon.

Non-Traditional Contest Variants
Rotation Contest
Not all Contests involve just one Pokémon per 
participant. One interesting Contest variant forces a 
Trainer to perform with a different Pokémon each round 
of a Contest, or allows a Team of Trainers to compete by 
each taking the reins for one round of the Contest.  
These are simple to run. Before the Contest begins, a 
Trainer picks a number of Pokémon equal to the number 
of competitors in the Contest if they’re going it alone. 
A Team of Trainers must be composed of a number of 
Trainers equal to the total number of competing Teams. 
Each Trainer in a Team picks one Pokémon they will 
use during the Contest. 
During some Rotation Contests, a Trainer or Team 
may pick at the start of each round who will be making 
an Appeal, though each Pokémon may only make one 
Appeal during a Contest. In other Rotation Contests, 
you may decide that each Team or Trainer must decide 
the order their Pokémon will make Appeals before the 
Contest begins. The latter case is quite interesting if 
each round of the Contest features a different Contest 
Stat and it’s pre-determined beforehand which Stat goes 
with which Round. 
The Introduction Stage of a Contest works as normal for 
a single Trainer. They pick a Skill to roll to gain Contest 
Stat Dice. In a Team Rotation Contest, each Team picks 
one representative who makes a roll for them during the 
Introduction Stage.
The Performance Stage works as normal as well, with 
just the change that each round sees a different Pokémon 
making the Appeal. There is one crucial difference, 
however, which is that a Trainer or Team in a Rotation 
Contest cannot spend more than a total number of 
Contest Dice per Contest equal to twice the number of 
participants in the Contest. 
For example, in a 5 Team Rotation Contest, each Team 
may only spend a total of 10 Contest Dice during the 
Contest. This is because otherwise there’s no reason 
for each Pokémon to spend the maximum number of 
Contest Dice possible each round since they will only 
appear once in the Contest. 
One other important rule in a Rotation Contest is that 
anyone with a Feature that affects the Performance 
Stage of a Contest may use it at any time, even to target 
another Trainer’s Pokémon during their Appeal. This 
is so even if a Team has only one Coordinator or Style 
Expert in a Rotation Contest, they can use their skills to 
benefit the whole party and guide them to victory.
When calculating Experience Points for the Contest, use 
the total number of Pokémon involved in the Contest, 
but a Trainer or Team must split this Experience equally 
among all of the Pokémon they used in the Contest. 
Trainer Participant Contest
Many Trainers choose to learn to fight alongside their 
Pokémon, and they may choose to bring their combat 
skills into the Contest Hall too. 
In this Contest Variant, Trainers can use Moves to 
perform Appeals as well as their Pokémon. There are, 
once again, multiple ways this can be implemented. 
The simplest is to allow both Trainer and Pokémon to 
perform Appeals during each round of a Contest. The 
player can decide whether their Trainer or Pokémon 
performs an Appeal first during each round. Another 
way is to have the Trainer and Pokémon alternate turns 
making Appeals. 
Using the first method, Trainer and Pokémon track 
Voltage separately, though effects that refer to adjacent 
targets affect both the Pokémon and Trainer. For 
example, an Unsettling Move causes both an adjacent 
Trainer and Pokémon to lose 1 Voltage. You may allow 
certain interactions between the two using Contest 
Effects, such as a Trainer’s Get Ready Move doubling 
the dice from their Pokémon’s Appeal in the same round 
instead of their Move on the next, or using Attention 
Grabber to transfer Voltage from Trainer to Pokémon. 
Using the second method, the Pokémon and Trainer 
would share a single Voltage score and may both affect 
it with their Moves. In both methods, the Trainer and 
Pokémon share a single pool of Contest Stat Dice, and 
a Coordinator or Trainer with similar Features may use 
them on either themselves or their Pokémon. 


## Page 270

Pokémon Contests

Battle Contest
In a marked departure from the Contest norm, you may 
also run Contests that blend battling skill and dazzling 
performances. 
This is a good chance to allow Trainers who have a mild 
interest in Contests but are otherwise mainly focused 
on battling to try out the Contest Circuit without feeling 
in over their heads. It’s also a good way to conduct a one 
on one Contest without making the two sides feel like 
they’re just playing Solitaire without interacting with 
each other much. 
The winner of a Battle Contest isn’t whoever knocks out 
all of the opponent’s Pokémon. Rather, at the beginning 
of a Battle Contest, the two competing Trainers decide 
how many Pokémon they will each use in the Battle 
Contest, from 3 to 6. The Battle Contest runs for a 
number of rounds of combat equal to twice the number 
of Pokémon  the Trainers decide to use – so anywhere 
from 6 to 12. At the end of the last round, or when all of 
one Trainer’s Pokémon are knocked out, Appeal Points 
are tallied up, and the Trainer with the most Appeal 
Points wins the Battle Contest. 
The Introduction Stage of a Battle Contest works the 
same as a normal Contest; each Trainer makes a Skill 
Check to generate Contest Stat Dice, which any of their 
Pokémon may use during the Battle Contest, though 
this doesn’t affect turn order or Initiative in any way.
Battle Contests play out much like normal battles, 
except that along with making Accuracy and Damage 
Rolls with each attack, Pokémon make Appeal Rolls for 
each Move they perform. Struggle Attacks, even those 
used to perform Combat Maneuvers, aren’t generally 
considered performance-worthy and do not have 
Appeal Rolls. 
Obviously, there are a few differences in Contest Effects 
that have to be applied to a Battle Contest. Turn order is 
decided by Initiative like a normal battle, and positioning 
is different as well – all opposing Pokémon on the field 
are counted as “adjacent” for Contest purposes. 
A few special rules are in place too that will affect basic 
combat mechanics. Voltage is tracked per Pokémon on a 
Trainer’s team, and only the currently active Pokémon’s 
Voltage applies to an Appeal Roll. Whenever a Pokémon 
knocks out a foe with an attack, they gain +2 Voltage. If 
a Pokémon is knocked out via damage over time effects 
such as Poison, Burn, or Hail, then this Voltage bonus 
simply goes to the opposing Trainer’s current active 
Pokémon. Whenever a Pokémon is recalled into its 
Poké Ball, it loses 2 Voltage. Being recalled as a result 
of Baton Pass, U-Turn, and Volt Switch does not trigger 
this Voltage loss – this includes uses of Juggler Features 
which perform a similar effect to these Moves. 
Whenever a Trainer has a Pokémon knocked out, the 
Pokémon they send out as a replacement is in the Center 
of Attention for the first turn that it acts. 
In a Battle Contest, it is important to weigh the benefits 
of knocking out foes quickly versus setting up powerful 
combos with Contest Effects and gaining Voltage. The 
Moves with the most useful Contest Effects for a given 
round aren’t always those with the best in-battle effects 
for the current situation.
There’s also a trade-off between using one Pokémon 
consistently through the Battle Contest and switching 
often. Keeping one Pokémon out lets the audience 
see then for longer and allows them to build up their 
Voltage more consistently than if you were switching, 
but it can open you up to an enemy exploiting Type 
Effectiveness. Switching consumes Pokémon turns that 
would otherwise be used for gaining Appeal Points, but 
it can also allow you to expose a variety of Pokémon 
that each have their own pool of Contest Stat Dice to use 
throughout the Battle Contest. Even so, it’s common in 
a Battle Contest for a Pokémon to go completely unused 
due to the limited number of rounds.
It’s possible to use this Contest variant for double 
or triple battles as well, but keep in mind that rolling 
Appeal in addition to Accuracy and Damage already 
extends the amount of time that Battle Contests take. 
Further extending this by introducing more combatants 
may not be the best idea!
