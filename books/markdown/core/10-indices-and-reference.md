Indices and Reference
Special Capabilities
The Basic Capabilities can be found in their own section in the Playing the Game Chapter (page 219) along with 
the mechanics for how they work. However, there are also special capabilities that denote the various powers that 
Pokémon have, such as turning invisible and shrinking in size. 
Alluring: Pokémon who are Alluring smell very 
pleasant. Once per day, they may act as if they were a 
Bait Item. If a Pokémon learns the Move Sweet Scent 
and does not have the Alluring Capability, they gain the 
Alluring Capability.
Amorphous: Pokémon that are Amorphous have 
an inconsistent shape. They can flatten and reform 
themselves like putty. They can stretch out their body 
material and condense themselves as well. They’re able 
to squeeze through tight spaces, such as under a door. 
Aura Reader: These Trainers and Pokémon can read 
the Auras of other living beings.  Each Aura conveys 
two pieces of information. First, its hue or color reveals 
something about the personality of the target. The 
hue of an Aura may change over time if an individual 
undergoes significant changes in personality or 
worldview.  Second, Auras also appear brightened or 
darkened at times. Brightened auras can reflect good 
moods and intentions, whereas darkened auras can 
reflect a sour mood or deceptive and negative intentions.
Aura Pulse:  Pokémon and Trainers with Aura Pulse are 
blessed by a great power. They can project their thoughts 
using Aura, straight into the minds of those they wish to 
communicate with. They can read the surface thoughts 
of minds in return, but only minds that open up to them 
willingly.
Blindsense: Zubat, Deino, and Deino’s Evolutions are 
blind, but can generally function through increased 
senses – Blindsense can take the form of echolocation, 
increased hearing, enhanced sense of smell, a supernat-
ural awareness of the environment, and more. It is, how-
ever, unable to distinguish colors or exact forms (read-
ing words on a book would be impossible, for example). 
Pokémon and Trainers with Blindsense can function 
even in complete darkness, as if they had Darkvision, 
and they can never be Blinded.
Bloom: When a Pokémon with Bloom, Cherrim, is in 
Sunny weather it transforms; changing its appearance 
from the closed bud, purple-petal form into the pink 
open flower form.

Blender:  Pokémon with Blender are capable of 
changing their color to match their surroundings. As 
a Shift Action, they may increase their Evasion by +2 
against Melee attacks and by +4 against Ranged attacks 
until the end of their next turn. This Capability may be 
performed At-Will.
Chilled: Pokémon with the Chilled Capability are 
always cold. 
Darkvision: A Pokémon with the Darkvision Capability 
never has their vision hampered by a loss of light. They 
can even see in total darkness and are never Blind or 
affected by Total Blindness due to low-light conditions.
Dead Silent: A Pokémon with the Dead Silent capability 
does not breathe or have a heartbeat, and does not 
shuffle or make noise as they walk unless they wish to.
Delta Evolution: Rayquaza may Mega-Evolve without 
holding a Mega Stone as long as it knows the Move 
Dragon Ascent. 
Dream Mist: A Pokémon of at least Level 20 who has 
the Dream Mist Capability can produce Dream Mist 
once a day as an Extended Action. Dream Mist may be 
collected with a Collection Jar. 
Dream Reader: Pokémon with the Dream Reader 
Capability may view the dreams of Sleeping Pokémon 
and Trainers. If the Pokémon or Trainer was put to Sleep 
with a Dream Mist item, they may also form a moving 
image of the dream from the Dream Mist in the target, 
allowing others to get a brief glance of the contents of 
the dream. Pokémon with this Capability cannot read 
the dreams of targets with the Mindlock Capability.
Egg Warmer: A Pokémon with Egg Warmer may heat 
up an egg once per 24 hours. Roll 1d10; on a result of 
1, nothing happens; on a result of 2-10, the egg’s hatch 
time is reduced, in hours, by the number rolled.
Firestarter: The Pokémon’s Struggle Attacks may be 
Fire-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special 
Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal 
Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Fire-Type Moves 
grant Firestarter.
Fortune: Once a day, a Pokémon of at least Level 20 
with this Capability may be allowed to roam freely in a 
City or Town for at least one hour. The user then returns 
with an amount of money equal to its Level multiplied 
by 1d10. If the user is a Pokémon with a Loyalty of 1 or 
0, it may not return and instead run away.
Fountain: The Pokémon’s Struggle Attacks may be 
Water-Typed if they wish. They may also add their 
Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack 
deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Water-Type 
Moves grant Fountain.
Freezer: The Pokémon’s struggle Attacks may be Ice-
Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special 
Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal 
Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Ice-Type Moves 
grant Freezer.
Gather Unown: Pokémon of at least Level 20 with 
the Gather Unown Capability can summon a random 
Unown once a week as a Standard Action. The Unown 
has a Level of 2d8, but it cannot exceed the user’s Level. 
They are not immediately hostile.
Gilled: A Gilled Pokémon can breathe underwater. 
It never needs to come up for air and can remain 
underwater for as long as it wants to. 
Glow: A Pokémon with the Glow Capability can emit 
light from a part of its body. Depending on the variety 
of wild Pokémon nearby, it might attract Pokémon or 
ward them away. If a Pokémon learns the Move Flash, 
Eerie Impulse, or Tail Glow and does not have the Glow 
Capability, they gain Glow. 
Groundshaper: A Pokémon with the Groundshaper 
Capability can transform the terrain around them to 
create Rough Terrain or Slow Terrain or Terrain that 
is both, or flatten out Rough Terrain to create Basic 
Terrain.  Using this Capability is an At-Will Standard 
Action that affects all cardinally adjacent squares. All 
squares need not be affected in the same way, and the 
user may choose not to affect certain squares at all if 
they wish.
Guster: The Pokémon’s Struggle Attacks may be Flying-
Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special 
Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal 
Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Flying-Type 
Moves grant Guster.

Heart Gift: Pokémon of at least Level 30 with this 
Capability can produce a Heart Scale item once a week 
as an Extended Action.
 
Heater: A Pokémon with the Heater Capability is always 
warm. 
Herb Growth: Pokémon of at least Level 20 with this 
Capability may produce a Revival Herb once a day as 
an Extended Action. This Herb may be harvested by a 
Trainer. 
Honey Gather: Once a day, Pokémon with this Capability 
can find a Honey item as an Extended Action if they are 
allowed time in an environment with abundant plant 
life. Honey may be collected with a Collection Jar.
Illusionist: Pokémon with the Illusionist Capability can 
create minor visual Illusions as a Standard Action. These 
may be no more than half a meter in any dimension 
and produce no sensory sensations outside of sight. 
Any physical contact noticeably disrupts an Illusion, 
and all other effects that see through Illusions can do 
so. Otherwise, the Illusion appears life-like and can 
be made to move, though it cannot move further than 
the user’s Focus Rank in meters away from the user. 
Actively manipulating the Illusion requires constant 
attention from the user. For minor effects such as 
making an illusionary flame dance, this requires the 
user to constantly spend its Swift Actions. For more 
major effects such as animating an illusionary skeleton, 
the user must constantly spend Standard Actions. If a 
Pokémon gains the Illusion Ability and does not have 
the Illusionist Capability, they gain Illusionist.
Inflatable: A Pokémon with the capability Inflatable 
can expand its size up to 125% of its normal size as a 
Standard Action. While Inflated, a Pokémon does not 
change its weight. When Inflated, Pokémon gain a -1 
Penalty to Evasion, but become Blocking Terrain; you 
may not target through an Inflated Pokémon. Returning 
to normal size is a Shift Action. If a Pokémon learns 
the Move Growth or Stockpile and does not have the 
Inflatable Capability, they gain Inflatable.
 
Invisibility: Pokémon who have the Invisibility 
Capability can turn invisible as a Shift Action. Pokémon 
may not perform Moves while invisible. While invisible, 
you must roll +4 during Accuracy Checks to hit the 
Pokémon. When a Pokémon turns invisible, they can 
only remain invisible for up to 4 minutes or can turn 
visible again as a Free Action. After becoming visible, 
they must wait two plus the number of minutes they 
spent invisible before turning invisible again. 
Juicer: When Shuckle is holding a berry, after 24 hours 
of that Berry going unused, it will be turned into Berry 
Juice and stored in the Shuckle’s shell.  Shuckle may use 
Berry Juice as a Snack Item; if the juice is bottled, other 
Pokémon and Trainers may drink the Berry Juice as a 
Refreshment. If a Berry Juice item is left in the Shuckle’s 
shell unused for two weeks it solidifies and turns into a 
Rare Candy. 
Keystone Warp: Spiritomb carries around with it an 
Odd Keystone. Trainers may collect additional Odd 
Keystones as they travel. They may then synchronize 
them with a Spiritomb for the cost of 2 Tutor Points. 
A Spiritomb may then freely teleport between any Odd 
Keystones within 10 meters as a Standard Action.
Letter Press: Unown with the Letter Press capability 
may be combined with other Unown, creating a Prime 
Unown, or adding to an existing Prime Unown. The 
first four times you add an Unown to a Prime Unown, 
including the creation of the Prime Unown, add 5 points 
to any one of the Prime Unown’s Base stats. Combined 
Unown may retain different instances of Hidden Power 
from each individual Unown, up the normal Move List 
limit. When combining Unown with the Letter Press 
capability, for each instance of Hidden Power, choose 
whether it will operate on Attack stat or Special Attack 
stat. This choice is permanent. Unowns combined with 
Letter Press can be kept in a single Poké Ball, essentially 
becoming a single Pokémon. Once combined with Letter 
Press, Unowns cannot be separated. Prime Unown lose 
the Underdog Capability.
Living Weapon: In addition to being a Pokémon, 
Honedge and its evolutionary relatives also count as 
equipment and may be used as such if the Pokémon 
is willing.  Honedge may be used as a Small Melee 
Weapon.  Doublade may be used as two Small Melee 
Weapons; when one is held in each hand, the user 
gains +2 to Evasion.  Aegislash may be used as a Small 
Melee Weapon and a Light Shield. When Fainted, 
these Pokémon may still be used as inanimate pieces 
of equipment, but all rolls made with them take a -2 
penalty.


## Page 306

Indices and Reference
306
If the Living Weapon is also being used as an active 
Pokémon, the Wielder and the Living Weapon use the 
Wielder’s Movement Speed to shift during each of their 
turns, and the total amount Shifted during the round 
cannot exceed the Wielder’s Movement Speed. 
While wielded, the Living Weapon may impart its 
wielder benefits as if it were a Simple or Fine Weapon, 
as long as the wielder has the requisite Combat Skill 
Rank. A Honedge counts as a Simple Weapon and 
grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike. A Doublade 
counts as a Simple Weapon and Grants the Adept Move 
Double Swipe. An Aegislash counts as a Fine Weapon 
and grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike and the 
Master Move Bleed!. While used as a Living Weapon, 
the Pokémon also adds these Moves to its own Move 
List, so long as their wielder qualifies to access them.
Either the Living Weapon or the Wielder can disengage 
as a Swift Action during their turn to Shift and attack 
separately. Re-engaging is a Standard Action that may 
be taken by either party.  While Wielded, a Living 
Weapon cannot benefit from its No Guard Ability, and 
an Aegislash is automatically in Blade forme.
 
Magnetic:  Magnetic Pokémon can lightly manipulate 
magnetic fields. With this, they can repel or attract 
iron and/or steel, holding it to their body or pushing 
it away. Through this magnetic manipulation, they can 
also feel magnetic fields and discern magnetic north. 
If a Pokémon learns the Move Magnet Rise or Magnet 
Bomb, or gains the Magnet Pull Ability, and does not 
have the Magnetic Capability, they gain Magnetic. 
Marsupial: Kangaskhan is always born with the Baby 
Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting 5 from 
each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan have the 
Baby Template, they live in their mother’s pouch and 
will not willingly leave it for long; their bond is so 
strong, that both Pokémon are able to be captured in 
a single Pokeball during this time. While Kangaskhan 
has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to 
fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with 
a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting 
their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside 
their mother’s pouch while she is conscious. Trainers 
raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother 
Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources 
and give that Experience to the baby instead. Once a 
Baby Kangaskhan reaches level 25 and loses the Baby 
Template, it exits its mother’s pouch permanently. If its 
mother had a loyalty higher than 1, it will allow itself to 
be easily caught by its Trainer.
Materializer: The Pokémon’s struggle Attacks may 
be Rock-Typed if they wish. They may also add their 
Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack 
deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Rock-Type 
Moves grant Materializer.
Milk Collection: The user may produce a MooMoo 
Milk Item once a day as an Extended Action as long 
as they are at least Level 20. MooMoo Milk may be 
collected with a Collection Jar.
Mindlock: Pokémon who have the Capability Mindlock 
cannot have their minds read by Telepathy, are immune 
to the Move Mind Reader, cannot have their emotions 
calmed with Gentle Vibe, and Telepathic Warning 
cannot trigger on their attacks. The Dream Reader 
Capability cannot read their dreams.
Mountable X: This Pokémon may serve as a mount for 
X average Trainers regardless of Power Capability and 
ignoring penalties for weight carried. This Capability 
fails to function if significant weight is added in addition 
to the Trainer(s). Note that this Capability is meant to 
be used as a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Feel 
free to adjust which Pokémon can be ridden as fits your 
campaign.
Mushroom Harvest: Pokémon of at least Level 20 with 
this Capability can produce a mushroom item once a day 
as an Extended Action. Roll 1d20 when this Capability 
is used. On a roll of 1-12, a Tiny Mushroom is produced. 
On a roll of 13-18, a Big Mushroom is produced. On a 
roll of 19-20, a Balm Mushroom is produced.
Naturewalk: Naturewalk is always listed with Terrain 
types in parentheses, such as Naturewalk (Forest and 
Grassland). Pokémon with Naturewalk treat all listed 
terrains as Basic Terrain.
Pack Mon:  A Pokémon with Pack Mon instinctively 
belong to a rigid pack structure, and are naturally 
inclined to the top of that structure. Wild Pokémon 
that are of this Pokémon’s unevolved form or at least 10 
levels lower than the user will instantly obey the user’s 
commands; showing a Pokémon with Pack Mon to a 
group of Wilds will put them at a Fearful disposition. 
However, two Pack Mons of the same species and within 
10 Levels of each other will fight for dominance of the 


## Page 307

Indices and Reference
307
group. If a Wild Pack Leader is ten levels higher than 
your Pokémon, it will expect your Pokémon to obey it, 
and may attack if it does not. 
Pearl Creation: When a Pokémon with this Capability 
Evolves, it loses this Capability and creates a Pink Pearl 
Held Item. 
Phasing: A Pokémon with Phasing may Shift through 
Slow Terrain without their Speed Capabilities being 
affected. As a Standard action, they may turn completely 
Intangible. While Intangible, they cannot be targeted by 
Moves or attacks, cannot perform Standard Actions, 
and lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of each round. 
While Intangible, they may pass through solid walls 
and all other blocking terrain during their Shift Action. 
Becoming Tangible again is a Shift Action.
 
Planter: Pokémon with the Planter Capability can act as 
a Portable Grower, holding one plant at a time. Pokémon 
with this Capability may be limited in what they can 
grow. In these cases, they will have parentheses on their 
Planter Capability denoting what they can grow. For 
example, Planter (Berries) would allow the Pokémon to 
grow Berry plants only.
Premonition: Pokémon with this Capability have 
a supernatural sense for natural disasters such as 
earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The 
magnitude of the impending disaster and its proximity 
to the Pokémon both affect how often they get this sense 
before a disaster and how long in advance the warning 
is. Closer and bigger disasters tend to have a greater 
effect and may alert the Pokémon to the specific area 
where a disaster will occur days in advance, while lesser 
disasters may simply give the Pokémon an odd sense of 
unease several hours before they hit.
Reach: A Pokémon with Reach has the Range of their 
Melee attacks increased based on their size category; 
Small and Medium Pokémon may make Melee attacks 
from up to 2 meters away, and Large and bigger 
Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 3 meters 
away.  Pokémon with Reach are either really large or 
have a stretchy limb with which they can strike foes 
from a distance.
Shadow Meld: Gengar can melt into shadows to remain 
unseen as a Standard Action. While doing so, Gengar 
receives a +4 bonus to Stealth rolls, gains +1 to its 
evasion, and can travel along a surface as if completely 
flat. Gengar may also “ride” along on a living creature’s 
shadow, moving along with it as the creature moves. 
Gengar may not use Standard Actions while melded 
into shadow. Reforming is a Shift Action.
Shapeshifter: Pokémon with this Capability can 
change their shape at will, taking on different forms 
as a Standard Action. When using this Capability, 
the user cannot increase or decrease its total mass by 
more than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex 
machines such as computers or phones. They may take 
on the appearance of these devices, but they will appear 
simplified in comparison. They can, however, transform 
into other moving forms such as acting as someone’s 
prosthetic limb, a living lever or pulley system, or a 
Pokémon comparable in size. Note in this last case 
that the Shapeshifter doesn’t gain any qualities of that 
Pokémon without actually using the Move Transform! 
Anyone closely examining a Shapeshifter Pokémon 
may determine its true nature with a Perception Check 
opposed by the Pokémon’s Stealth. If a Pokémon learns 
the Move Transform and does not have the Shapeshifter 
Capability, they gain Shapeshifter.
Shrinkable:  A Pokémon with the capability Shrinkable 
can shrink its size up to 25% of its normal size as a 
Standard Action, but this does not change its weight. 
While Shrunken, a Pokémon may not perform Standard 
Actions except to return to normal size, and gains a +4 
bonus to Evasion. Using Shrinkable is not the same 
as using the Move Minimize, but if a Pokémon learns 
the Move Minimize and does not have the Shrinkable 
Capability, they gain Shrinkable.
Soulless:  Shedinja is a unique Pokémon. Its default 
Ability will always be Wonder Guard and Shedinja’s Max 
Hit Points is always 1. You may not add to a Shedinja’s 
Hit Point stat, and Shedinja may not have Temporary 
Hit Points. However, Shedinja can’t die and never gains 
Injuries. Given an Extended Rest, Shedinja always 
recovers to 1 Hit Point regardless of natural healing rate 
and how many Hit Points it had previously. 
Split Evolution: Wurmple evolves based on its Nature; 
if it has a Nature that raises Attack, Special Attack, or 
Speed, it evolves into Silcoon. If it has a Nature that 
raises HP, Defense, or Special Defense, it evolves into 
Cascoon.
Sprouter: Once per week, Pokémon with the Sprouter 
capability can rapidly influence the growth of plants 


## Page 308

Indices and Reference
308
and flora around them. As a Standard Action, they may 
cause a plant around them to bloom, and potentially 
grow up to 1 meter in any direction. Sprouter may cause 
planted Berries to instantly give yield. 
Stealth: A Pokémon with the Stealth Capability are 
excellent at approaching the enemy for an up close 
assault. While Shifting, unless they purposely want 
to, Stealth Pokémon do not make any noise. Unless a 
Pokémon with Stealth has used a Ranged Move during 
the current round or the round previous, Ranged 
Moves may not target them if the line of sight drawn 
goes through Rough Terrain or if the Pokémon is on 
Rough Terrain. 
Telekinetic: Telekinetic Pokémon and Trainers can 
move objects with their mind. They can lift things with 
Telekinesis as if they were using a Power Capability 
equal to their Focus Rank. When lifting Staggering 
Weights with Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead 
of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. They can 
target objects up to 8 meters away. Count the combined 
weight of all objects when determining whether they 
can lift all of them. Using this Capability to lift the user’s 
Drag Weight or greater leaves discoverable psychic 
residue. Additionally, the user may use Struggle Attacks 
at a range of X, where X is the user’s Focus Rank. These 
Struggle Attacks deal Normal-Type Damage as usual, 
but the user may add their Special Attack instead of their 
Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they 
wish. The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and Push 
Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic Capability 
and using the Focus Skill for all opposed rolls. When 
the Push Maneuver is used this way, the user does not 
repeat the Push but instead Pushes the target a number 
of meters equal to half their Focus Rank. If a Pokémon 
learns the Move Psychic or Telekinesis and does not 
have the Telekinetic Capability, they gain Telekinetic. 
Telepath: A Telepathic Pokémon can read the surface 
thoughts of people and other Pokémon X meters 
away where X is Focus Rank doubled. Pokémon with 
Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds of 
other Trainers or Pokémon with Telepathy. Trainers 
with Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds 
of any Trainer or Pokémon. Telepathy can be used to 
read only one target at a time but can project to on a 
number of separate targets at once equal to half the 
user’s Focus Rank. Telepathy may be used to read 
minds with or without making the target aware of the 
attempt. Unwilling targets and targets that are unaware 
automatically resist the Telepathy attempt; the user 
and target roll opposed Focus Checks to determine if 
the Telepathy attempt is successful. A failure imposes a 
cumulative -3 penalty to future checks to use Telepathy 
on that target for the next 24 hours. Using Telepathy on 
an Unwilling target leaves discoverable psychic residue.
Threaded:  Pokémon with the Threaded Capability may 
make a Threaded Shift as a Shift Action. A Threaded Shift 
is when a Pokémon targets an object and shoots a strong, 
thin line of silk, or extends a vine from themselves, and 
then quickly retracts that silk, or vine, pulling itself 
towards the object if the Pokémon is lighter than the 
object, or pulling the object towards the Pokémon if it is 
lighter than the user. Threaded has a range of 4 meters. 
If you target an unwilling Pokémon or Trainer with 
threaded, Threaded requires an AC 6 Status Attack to 
use. If a Pokémon learns the Move Spider Web, String 
Shot, Vine Whip or Power Whip and does not have the 
Threaded Capability, they gain Threaded. 
Tracker:  Pokémon with the Tracker Capability have a 
strong sense of smell that they can use to follow other 
Pokémon or people. If the Pokémon has smelt whom 
they want to track in the past day, or one of their personal 
belongings, they can pursue that prey with a Perception 
check of 8 or better. To pick-up a random scent from 
nothing, a Perception check of 14 or better will allow 
the Pokémon to follow that scent. To pick-up a specific 
scent from nothing, a Perception check of 20 will allow 
the Pokémon to follow that scent. A Pokémon may only 
make these checks once per hour. If a Pokémon learns 
the Move Odor Sleuth and does not have the Tracker 
Capability, they gain Tracker.
Tremorsense: Pokémon with the Tremorsense Capabil-
ity can sense the location, size, and shape of objects in 
the ground around them for up to 5 meters, almost as if 
they could see through the ground.
Underdog: This capability denotes Pokémon who 
qualify for the Underdog Class’s effects. They are 
Pokémon species with a Base Stat total of 45 or less. 
Some exceptions apply.
Volatile Bomb: The Pokémon never loses Loyalty from 
using Self-Destruct or Explosion.

Wallclimber:  Wallclimber Pokémon often have suction 
cups, hooks, or other means of easily scaling walls or 
other vertical surfaces. They may travel along a wall or 
ceiling at a rate of half of their Overland Capability.
Weathershape: Castform’s appearance changes with the 
weather around it. It changes to its orange form in Sunny 
weather, its blue and grey form in Raining weather, its 
light blue form when it’s Hailing, a rocky brown form in 
a Sandstorm.
Wielder: Pokémon with the Wielder Capability gain a 
+2 bonus to Disarming and cannot have their natural 
weapons disarmed or removed by moves such as Thief, 
Covet, Switcheroo, and Trick. Small Pokémon with this 
capability may additionally wield man-made Small 
Melee weapons, gaining all normal benefits. Medium 
and higher size category Pokémon may wield Large 
Melee weapons. These weapons occupy the Pokémon’s 
Held Item slot when Wielded. Pokémon Wielding 
Weapons can only ever get access to Adept Combat 
Rank Moves from Weapons, even if their Combat Skill 
would allow them to qualify for higher. 
Wired: Wired Pokémon have a special relation to 
electronic devices. They can enter machines and travel 
through connected electronics through any cords that 
connect them instantly. If used by a Rotom, Rotom 
may take control of the machine from within, gaining a 
Move chosen by your GM based on the machine.
 
X-Ray Vision: Pokémon and Trainers with the X-Ray 
Vision Capability can see through walls and solid objects 
up to a foot in thickness. Objects seen through X-Ray 
vision are seen as white shapes and outlines without 
much detailed definition. The effectiveness of X-Ray 
Vision depends on the object’s material. Anything thin 
from paper to light wood to most residential drywall 
allows clear X-Ray Vision through it, while lead and 
tungsten would block X-Ray Vision entirely.
Zapper: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Electric-
Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special 
Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal 
Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Electric-Type 
Moves grant Zapper.

Abilities are a special type of trait that Pokémon and 
some Trainers can have. Pokémon are all born with one 
Ability and may naturally grow to learn others or can 
be taught them by a dedicated Trainer. Most Abilities 
are passive effects, or Static in game terms, that are 
constantly on whether for good or ill. Other activate 
when certain conditions are met, such as the presence 
of a particular Weather or being hit by a specific Type 
of attack. A few Abilities require more active focus to 
execute and take up a Pokémon or Trainer’s Standard 
Action just as a Move would. 
Abilities are read much like Moves or Features are.
Name: The Name is what the Ability is called. This is 
useful for keeping track of what Ability your Pokémon 
has.
Frequency – Action Type: The Frequency is how often 
the Ability can be used. These generally are Static, At-
Will, Scene, or Daily.  These Frequencies are the same 
as Feature or Move Frequencies of the same name. 
The Action Type listed determines the sort of action 
required to activate the ability – usually a free action.
Effect: The Effect is of course what the Ability does.
Ability Keywords
Some abilities may have a Keyword descriptor. See 
below for the Ability keywords.
Connection: This keyword is followed by a Move, with 
which the user has an innate connection. Upon gaining 
the Ability, the user learns the Move, forgetting another 
Move if necessary. This Move cannot be forgotten 
through any means. If the user has 1 Tutor Point, 
they may immediately spend it to gain the “Advanced 
Connection” Edge and avoid forgetting any Moves. 
Defensive: 
Immune: Abilities with the keyword Immune cannot be 
affected by a certain Status Affliction. This is described 
per Ability.
Last Chance: Last Chance Abilities are always associated 
with an Elemental Type. The user gains a +5 bonus to 
Damage Rolls when using attacks of that Type. This 
bonus increases to +10 when the user is under 1/3rd of 
their Maximum Hit Points. 
Pickup: The Ability Pickup lets Pokémon or Trainers 
find items using their natural senses and natural 
curiosity, or using psychic abilities. Whenever the ability 
is activated, roll 1d20 and consult the chart below. The 
chart determines the category of Item, but the GM 
decides what the specific Item is.

Moves are the main forms of Pokémon Attacks in 
Pokémon Tabletop United. Pokémon may know a 
maximum of 6 Moves; Trainers may know as many 
Moves as their Features allow. Moves are, unless stated 
otherwise, performed as a Standard Action. Moves in 
this documented are presented like this:
Move: Attack Order 
Type: Bug 
Frequency: EOT
AC: 2 
Damage Base 9: 2d10+10 / 21
Class: Physical 
Range: 6, 1 Target
Effect: Attack Order is a Critical Hit on 18+.
Contest Type: Smart 
Contest Effect: Incentives
Move: The first line contains the Name of the Move. This 
is of course, what you use to keep track of the Move, and 
write down in your Pokémon’s Move List.
Type: Next is the Elemental Type of the Move. There 
are Bug, Dark, Dragon, Electric, Fairy, Fighting, Fire, 
Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice, Normal, Poison, 
Psychic, Rock, Steel and Water Moves! This will 
determine Type Effectiveness  since Moves are broken 
up by their respective Type.
Frequency :   The Frequency is the rate of use. There are 
five levels of Frequency for Moves. 
»»
At-Will means your Pokémon can perform the 
attack as often as it’d like, with no rest needed to 
perform the attack again.
»»
EOT is an abbreviation for Every Other Turn, and 
it means your Pokémon can perform the move once 
every other turn. If your Pokémon uses an EOT 
frequency Move outside of battle, it would need ten 
seconds of rest before performing the move again. 
»»
Scene X: This Frequency means this Move can be 
performed X times per Scene. Moves that simply 
have the Scene Frequency without a number can be 
performed once a Scene. Moves that can be used 
multiple times a Scene can still only be used Every 
Other Turn within a Scene and not on consecutive 
turns. 
»»
Daily is the lowest Frequency. This Move’s Frequency 
is only refreshed by an Extended Rest, or by a visit 
to the Pokémon Center. Moves that can be used 
multiple times Daily can still only be used once 
a Scene and not multiple times within the same 
Scene. 
»»
Static, like with Features, means this Move has some 
effect that is always granted to the user, as long as 
they know this Move.
Accuracy Check: The Accuracy Check is used when 
a Pokémon uses a Move as an Attack. The Accuracy 
Check is the number you need to match or exceed on 
your Accuracy Roll in order for the Attack to connect to 
your target. See the Combat chapter for details.
Damage Base: This indicates the base amount of 
damage dealt. See the ‘Damage’ section in the Combat 
Chapter for more details (page 236). Many Abilities and 
other effects can modify Damage Bases.
Moves
The following two pages 
are important, and you 
should read them. 
Of particular note, look at how the Scene and Daily 
frequencies work for Moves. They aren’t quite the 
same as how they might work for Features or other 
effects that have a Frequency. 


## Page 338

Indices and Reference

Class: Class will denote whether the attack is Physical, 
Special or Status. Physical Attacks are resisted by 
Defense; Special Attacks are resisted by Special Defense. 
Some attacks may be Physical or Special but not have 
Damage Dice Rolls; that means the damage these attacks 
do still interact with other effects such as Counter or 
Mirror Coat that specify a damage class.  Status Moves 
are simply moves that are neither Physical nor Special.
Range: Range specifies the distance in meters from 
which the Move can hit. Keywords are also inserted 
in this line; see the following section for a detail of 
keywords. Besides the standard numerical distances, 
other common distances include Melee, Self, and Field. 
Self moves simply target the user; Melee Moves have a 
range of 1, and thus must target an adjacent target.  The 
Field Range drops an effect on the entire area where the 
battle is taking place. When using area-of-effect Moves, 
such as ones with the Burst or Cone keywords, make a 
single Accuracy Roll for the entire attack.
Effect:  The Effect lists what the attack does in addition 
to the Move’s damage. Certain effects will only occur 
if, during Accuracy Roll, a certain number or higher 
is rolled. Effects do not activate unless the Move hits. 
Effect Ranges can be extended by other effects. For 
example, an effect that triggers on 18+ that has its Effect 
Range extended by +2 now triggers on 16+.
Effects such as Features and Abilities that extend the 
Critical Hit or Effect Ranges of a Move cannot extend 
them by more than a total of +6 from their natural 
ranges. 
Contest Type/Effect: These two Contest Fields indicate 
what Contest Type the Move is tied to. There are only 5 
different Contest Types: Beauty, Cool, Cute, Smart, and 
Tough. The Contest Effect determines what effect the 
move has in Contests. See the Contest chapter for more.
Special: Some Moves grant Capabilities to Pokémon and 
Trainers learning the Move. When a Move is forgotten, 
all Capabilities granted by the Move are also lost.

Blessing: Safeguard, Lucky Chant, Reflect, and Light 
Screen provide a Blessing shared by the entire team. All 
Pokémon and Trainers allied to the user may benefit 
from the Blessing. The Blessing persists until it’s used 
up, even if the original user is KO’d or switched out.
Coat: Moves with the Coat keyword give the targets 
a certain effect while the Coat persists. Coats may be 
passed on by Baton Pass.
Dash: A Dash Move cannot be used if the user is Stuck.
Double Strike: Whenever a Move with Double Strike 
is used, make two Attack Rolls. If one Attack Roll hits, 
the Move does damage as indicated by its Damage Base 
value; if both Attack Rolls hit however, the Damage 
Base value is doubled. Each hit may Critically Hit 
separately; when adding damage from Critical Hit, add 
the Damage Base before it’s doubled. For example, if one 
Double Kick attack is a Critical Hit, add +1d8+5 to the 
damage roll. If both are Critical Hits, add +2d8+10. 
Environ: A Pokémon using a Move with the Environ 
keyword consults the chart below for what Move or 
effect to use.

Execute: These Moves automatically KO the target if 
they hit. The 1d100 roll may not be modified in any way 
or re-rolled through any means.
Exhaust: If a Move has the Exhaust keyword, the user 
forfeits their Standard and Shift actions on their next 
turn, and forfeits their trainer’s Command. If any of 
these actions has already been used up, the move Fails 
and does not activate.

Friendly: Moves with the Friendly Keyword do not hit 
allies.
Five Strike: Whenever a Move with Five Strike is used, 
roll 1d8. On a result of 1, the attack hits one time. On 
a result of 2 or 3, the attack hits two times. On a result 
of 4, 5, or 6, the attack hits three times. On a result of 
7, the attack hits four times. On a roll of 8, the attack 
hits five times.  Multiply the Move’s Damage Base by 
the number of times hit; that becomes its new Damage 
Base. You may always apply Technician to Moves with 
Five Strike. Apply STAB and all other effects that raise 
Damage Base only after the Move’s final Damage Base 
has been calculated.
Groundsource: Moves with the Groundsource keyword 
do not have their Accuracy modified by targeting into 
Rough Terrain and ignore Blocking Terrain.
Hazard: If a Move has the Hazard keyword, the effect 
covers a portion of the field of battle. A Hazard only 
affects the foes under certain circumstances. You may 
put extra Layers of the Move with Hazard if the Move 
allows, but only one per usage of the Move.
Illusion: These Moves are Illusions, and may be ignored 
by Trainers with the Clairsentient Feature.
Interrupt: Interrupt Moves may be declared in the 
middle of another combatant’s turn to allow the user 
to take an action. They work similarly to Priority 
(Advanced, Limited) effects in that they only allow you 
to take the action that has Interrupt and not a full turn.
Pass: At any point during a Shift, the user may declare a 
move with the Pass keyword. Once the Move is declared, 
the user may move forward only in a straight line, for up 
to 4 meters, treating foes as Regular Terrain  and moving 
through any enemies in its path. The user must end in 
an empty square. The Pass Move attacks all targets in 
each square it dashes through, but each target may be 
hit only once. The user must end their Shift at the end 
of the dash. Shifting as a result of the Pass keyword does 
not provoke Attacks of Opportunity. 
Fling: The Move Fling is very unique! Its effect depends on the held item of the user. If used a Trainer, they must 
throw an item in either hand.

The target of the attack takes no damage, and instead consumes the thrown item. 
This includes Basic Restoratives and Herbs, but not Bandages, Refreshments, or 
other items that are used as an Extended Action. When used this way, Restoratives 
don’t cause the target to forfeit a turn.
Poison Items
DB 3
The target becomes Poisoned. This category includes Toxic Orbs, and Poison-Type 
Boosters, Braces, and Plates.
Fire Items

The target becomes Burned. This category includes Flame Orbs, and Fire-type

This includes the Metal Powder, Rare Leek, Thick Club, and Pink Pearl Items, but 
only if the user is able to benefit from that item.

The user instead makes a ranged Struggle Attack using the thrown Weapon to

Pledge: Pledge Moves can generate a number of special 
effects. A Rainbow lasts for 5 rounds and increases the 
Effect Range of all allies’ attacks by +3. A Fire Hazard 
is a special type of Hazard. Any targets that begin or 
end their turn on a Fire Hazard are Burned. Anyone 
that passes through a Fire Hazard takes damage equal 
to 1/8th of their Max Hit Points. If a Ground, Rock, 
or Water-Type Move targets a square (or a target in a 
square) with Fire Hazard in them, the Fire Hazards are 
destroyed. All effects that destroy Hazards extinguish 
Fire Hazards.
Powder: Moves with the Powder keyword have no effect 
on Grass Type Pokémon. 
Priority: If the user has not already acted this turn, a 
Move with the Priority keyword may be declared to act 
immediately; the user takes their full turn, ignoring 
initiative. This counts as their turn for the round. A 
priority Move may not be declared during someone else’s 
turn; it must be declared between turns. Priority also 
comes in Priority (Limited) and Priority (Advanced) 
varieties. The Priority (Limited) keyword is like Priority 
except the user may not take their full turn; they may 
only take the action that itself has Priority and take the 
rest of their turn on their own Initiative Count. For 
example, Orders are Priority (Limited), meaning the 
user only uses their Standard Action and does not take a 
full turn. Priority (Advanced) Moves don’t require that 
the user hasn’t acted that turn; if they have, they simply 
give up their turn on the following round.
Push: The target of the attack is Pushed a specified 
amount of meters. Unless specified, the Push direction 
should be away from the user.
Reaction:  Reactions work exactly like Interrupts, except 
that they happen after the triggering condition is fully 
resolved, instead of before. Thus, the user must survive 
the trigger condition to be able to perform the reaction.
Recoil: When a Move says to Recoil, total the amount of 
damage the target took from your attack, then multiply 
by the fraction paired with the Keyword Recoil. The 
Move’s user loses Hit Points equal to that result.
Set-Up: These are two-turn Moves which require the 
user to prepare in some way. On the first turn, the 
Set-Up Effect is used; then on the following turn the 
Resolution Effect occurs.
Shield: Moves with this Keyword are Interrupts that 
are triggered by foes’ attacks. They usually prevent the 
effect of attacks in some manner.
Smite: When Moves with the Smite keyword Miss, 
instead of doing no damage, they deal damage as if 
the attack were resisted one step further. Targets dealt 
damage this way do not suffer any secondary effects of 
the Move. 
Social: Moves with the Social Keyword are based on 
social manipulation. They cannot be Intercepted and 
ignore the effects of Substitute.  Some Features and 
other effects also take advantage of this Keyword.
Sonic: Moves with the Sonic Keyword are based on 
sound. They ignore the effects of Substitute. 
Spirit Surge: A Move with the Spirit Surge keyword will 
have its Effect activate even if the Move does not hit a 
target. If the Move requires a certain Accuracy Roll, the 
roll must still be met. 
Trigger: Moves with the Trigger keyword are ONLY 
able to be used whenever the condition in their Effect 
line is met.
Vortex: While in a Vortex, the target is Slowed, Trapped, 
and loses a Tick of Hit Points at the beginning of each 
turn. At the end of each turn, the user may roll 1d20 
to end all of these effects; during the first turn, they 
must roll a 20 or higher to dispel the vortex. The DC is 
lowered by 6 each following turn, automatically wearing 
off on the fifth turn (20, 14, 8, 2, Dispel)
Weather: Moves with the Weather keyword affects 
an area, changing the rules of the battle. Damage can 
be altered and even the Effects of moves can change 
depending on the Weather in battle. There can only 
be one Weather Effect in place at a time; new Weather 
Effects replace old Weather Effects. Weather Conditions 
last 5 rounds. 
Note that despite their names, Weather Conditions are 
not usually found as natural occurrences. A bright and 
sunny day does not count as Sunny Weather, nor does 
rain count as Rainy Weather. However, particularly 
severe examples of the corresponding weather can 
count. For example, a tropical rainstorm could count as 
Rainy weather.

Range and Blocking Terrain
Blocking Terrain is usually pretty straightforward, but using it in conjunction with Moves that have an Area of 
Effect may get tricky. 
First of all, all Ranged single target Moves originate from the center of the user in most cases, though when using 
non-square shapes for combatants, such as a serpentine shape for a Milotic, they may instead originate from a 
specific spot on the body, such as the square(s) representing the head.
When determining whether Blocking Terrain applies, trace the path between the origin of a Move and the target 
and determine whether or not it passes through any Blocking Terrain that way. 
Bursts and Moves that hit all Cardinally Adjacent Targets originate from the user and spread outwards in all 
directions as shown below. In this case, Blocking Terrain placed blocking where the red lines are would prevent the 
Move from hitting targets in the corresponding cardinally adjacent squares. Pairs of red lines or blue lines forming 
“L” shapes could block the corner squares from being hit. 
Ranged Blasts work similarly to Bursts; consider their origin point to be the center of the Blast. 
Cones, Close Blasts, and Lines are all considered to originate from the user, and you trace the path between the 
user and the target square as with single target Moves to determine whether Blocking Terrain stops the Move. In 
the example below, there is a blue wall of Blocking Terrain in the way of the Cone. The Pink squares are hit, but the 
Gray ones are not, meaning only one of the three Totodiles is hit by the attack.

Glossary of Terms
Accuracy Check: This is the base value that must be 
rolled on a d20 to hit with a Move. Evasion is added to 
this value to determine the value that needs to be rolled 
to hit a foe.
Accuracy Roll: A d20 roll made to use an attack or 
Move against a foe. 
Adjacent: Two users that are next to each other, or 
within 1 meter in game terms, are said to be adjacent to 
each other. If the effect specifies Cardinally Adjacent 
this excludes targets that are next to the user diagonally.
Ally: Pokémon and Trainers that are on your side, of 
course. Notably “Allies” does not include yourself.
Area of Effect: Area of Effect refers to all squares 
affected by a particular Move or Feature; often refers 
to Bursts, Blasts, Lines, or Cones. Area of Effect attacks 
always use one accuracy and damage roll that is applied 
to all targets. 
Capability: Capabilities merely represent what charac-
ters “can do” in various fields. Ranges from very “Basic 
Capabilities” which include lifting strength and Move-
ment, to Special Capabilities.
Combat Stages: Combat Stages are incremental 
adjustments to a Pokémon or Trainer’s Stats ranging 
from -6 to +6 Stages. Each Stage applies a different 
multiplier to the affected stat. Accuracy and Evasion 
have changes like Combat Stages but are flat bonuses 
and penalties ranging from -6 to +6 rather than being 
associated with multipliers. Often abbreviated as CS 
in many Moves and Abilities. See page 235 for more 
information.  
Direct Damage: Damage dealt by Physical or Special 
Moves, as opposed to loss of life caused by effects such 
as poison or hail. 
Effect Range: Refers to the likelihood of activation 
of effects that occur dependent on accuracy roll. For 
example, Ember has an Effect Range of 18-20. If an 
Effect increases this Effect Range by +2, it would then 
be 16-20. 
EOT: A Frequency stands for “Every Other Turn”. So if 
you did it last round, you can’t do it this round!
Hit Points: A value derrived from Hit Points that 
represents a character’s health and stamina. Damage 
and Hit Point Loss detracts from Hit Points.
HP: A Combat Stat from which your Hit Points are 
derived.
Initiative: Initiative refers to both the general order in 
which characters act in combat, and the actual number 
which a Pokémon or Trainer uses to act. Usually, a 
character’s “Initiative” is simply equal to their Speed 
Stat, and characters then act from highest initiative to 
lowest. Certain effects, such as the Move Tailwind, may 
alter Initiative for a character without altering the Speed 
Stat itself.
Opposed Skill Check: An Opposed Skill Check is a 
Type of Skill Check in which two participants roll; first 
the participant that started the check, or the “Initiator”, 
and then the participant being acted upon – or the 
“Defender”. Most often, the Defender’s Skill Roll serves 
as the DC for the Initiator’s Skill Check. An example of 
an Opposed Skill Check is the Grappling Mechanic.
Scene: A unit of narrative time that is used as a 
Frequency. Any time there’s a timeskip for traveling, the 
PCs enter or leave a major location such as a town, or 
the characters catch a breather after a big event like a 
major battle, it’s a change in Scene. 
Tick of Hit Points: 1/10th of your Maximum Hit Points. 
Tick Value refers to this value. 
One Full Round: From the current Initiative Count to 
the end of the same Initiative Count during the next 
round.
