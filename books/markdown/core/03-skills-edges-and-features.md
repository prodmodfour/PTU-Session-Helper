Chapter 3:  
Skills, Edges, and Features
Introducing Your Trainer Options
Skills, Edges, and Features are the basic building blocks for a Trainer in Pokémon Tabletop United. Skills and Edges 
are related components of a Trainer that are used to develop their trained abilities and interests, whether in broader 
and more general ways with Skills or in more specific ways with Edges. Features are bigger units for character 
building that are usually contained in Trainer Classes. However, some of them are available to all Trainers. 
Skills 
Skills represent a character’s conscious interests and 
training. They’re used when taking most basic actions 
in Pokémon Tabletop United as well as acting as the 
main prerequisites for Features in the system. 
Skills are organized into three Categories: Body, Mind, 
or Spirit. While there isn’t much of a mechanical impact 
here outside of the Categoric Inclination Edge, it’s 
an easy way to think about the Skills as groups when 
making your character. 
»»
The Body Skills are Acrobatics, Athletics, Combat, 
Intimidate, Stealth, and Survival. 
»»
The Mind Skills are General Education, Medicine 
Education, Occult Education, Pokémon Education, 
Technology Eduction, Guile, and Perception.
»»
The Spirit Skills are Charm, Command, Focus, and 
Intuition. 
Look to the following pages for a more detailed write-
up of each Skill, including their various uses, common 
situations where each Skill is tested, and the Edges that 
are associated with each Skill. 
There are 6 Ranks of Skills. Each Rank causes you to roll 
a different number of dice when using Skills. When you 
“Rank Up” a Skill, it simply increases from one rank to 
the next. Skills begin at Untrained unless modified by 
a Background.

Master

There are Level prerequisites for progressing Skill 
Ranks beyond Novice. Adept Rank requires Level 2. 
Expert Rank requires Level 6, and Master Rank requires 
Level 12. 
Both the Rank number and the Dice Roll are important 
when it comes to Skills. The Skill Rank is often referred 
to by Edges and Features which use its numerical 
value. For example, Group Trainer allows a Trainer to 
train a number of Pokémon equal to their Command 
Rank. A Trainer with Adept Command could train four 
Pokémon at once with the Edge.  
The Dice Roll is used in making Skill Checks. Simply 
roll the the appropriate Dice Roll value for your Skill 
Rank and add any modifiers associated with that Skill 
coming from Equipment, Edges, and other effects.
For example, a Trainer with an Expert Athletics 
Skill would roll 5d6. That same Trainer with a Skill 
Enhancement Edge applied to Athletics would roll 
5d6+2.
When making general Skill Checks (that is, Skill Checks 
caused by a situation rather than directly called for by 
a Feature), your GM is the one who determines the 
Difficulty Check (or DC for short) for the check. A 
Skill Check must match or exceed its Difficulty Check 
to succeed the challenge.
An easy DC for most Untrained or better Trainers 
would be 5. 10 is a challenging DC. 15 is a hard DC 
that requires some Skill investment to pass. A DC of 25 
would be nigh-impossible for all but masters of their 
craft. See the Running the Game chapter for more 
details on setting Skill DCs (page 465).

Acrobatics
Acrobatics is a Body Skill that represents how well a 
character can jump, keep their balance, and in general 
conduct themselves physically with swiftness and 
grace.  Characters with a high Acrobatics Rank tend 
to be highly agile and well-coordinated, and it reflects 
in their activities. Gymnasts, parkour practitioners, 
circus performers, and dancers would all have a high 
Acrobatics Rank.
The Acrobatics Skill is used to make skill checks 
when your character has to perform physical 
tasks requiring a great deal of precision and 
finesse, usually, but not always, tied to jump-
ing and moving about. 
Some situations where you might roll Acrobatics include 
keeping your balance as you shimmy across a perilous 
ledge, jumping across slippery stones in a river, and 
dodging out of the way of falling debris from a cave-in 
or an earthquake. 
Outside of jumping and moving around, Acrobatics has 
uses when hand-eye coordination is required. Accurate 
throwing and juggling both rely on Acrobatics, and you 
will want a high Acrobatics Rank for exact tasks like 
switching a golden statue on a booby-trapped pedestal 
with a bag of sand.
Opposed Acrobatics Checks are used for races through 
obstacle courses or difficult terrain and for determining 
who recovers their footing first after being thrown off 
balance by unstable ground. 
Acrobatics can be used to mitigate damage taken 
from falling from great heights, as found in the Combat 
chapter (page 249). Acrobatics is also used to mount 
a Pokémon in the middle of battle and keep mounted 
even when under attack or affected by Status Afflictions 
(page 218). Acrobatics can be tested during Intercept 
Maneuvers (page 242).

Athletics
Athletics is a Body Skill that represents physical 
training and endurance developed through 
sports and exercise. Characters with a high 
Athletics Rank tend to be very active and 
either spend time training their physique or 
have physically strenuous occupations. 
The Athletics Skill is used to make general skill 
checks whenever your character’s physical endurance is 
tested, such as when running, climbing, or jumping. 
Some situations where you might make use of the 
Athletics Skill are when climbing a tree or the 
side of a cliff in the wilds and when trying 
to keep yourself afloat in the ocean during 
a storm. A GM may also call for Athletics 
Checks during a day of long travel, especially 
over treacherous terrain, to determine how fatigued 
your characters become from the long and continuous 
exertion. 
Opposed Athletics Checks can be called for determining 
who tires out first during an extended chase or for 
someone holding a door closed against someone trying 
to push it open. 
When in doubt, if characters are taking actions that 
involve strenuous physical activity but not necessarily 
anything that requires precision and finesse, Athletics 
is the go-to skill. A GM may also simply look at a char-
acter’s Athletics Rank and make a judgment call about 
whether or not that character is able to perform a cer-
tain task without becoming fatigued. If a GM assigns 
penalties for exhaustion, Athletics may be consulted in 
that case as well.
Having a high Athletics Skill improves a character’s 
movement speed and throwing range. See Step 6 of 
Character Creation for further details (page 16). It is also 
used when fishing (page 217). Athletics can be tested 
when using Intercept Maneuvers (page 242). Carrying 
especially heavy loads also requires continuous Athletics 
Checks (page 222).
Athletic Initiative
Prerequisites: Adept Athletics
Effect: You learn the Move Agility.
Mounted Prowess
Prerequisites: Novice Acrobatics or Athletics
Effect: You automatically succeed at Acrobatics and 
Athletics Checks made to mount a Pokémon, and you 
gain a +3 Bonus to all Acrobatics and Athletics Checks 
made to remain Mounted.

Ranks.
Stamina
Prerequisites: Expert Athletics or Expert Combat
Effect: Whenever you Take a Breather or take Massive 
Damage or a Critical Hit, you gain Temporary Hit 
Points equal to your Athletics or Combat Rank after the 
triggering action has resolved.

Combat
Combat is a Body Skill that represents training in physical fighting and specialized battle techniques. Combat can 
represent formal schooling in unarmed martial arts, weapons training, or simply very good street fighting and 
brawling. 
Not surprisingly, most uses of the Combat Skill take place in battle. Specifically, Combat is tested when performing 
certain Combat Maneuvers, including Pushing, Tripping, Grappling, and Disarming. Having a high Combat Skill 
also improves the damage and accuracy of a character’s Struggle Attacks (page 240). 
Having a high Combat Rank is also important to making the best use of Weapons. Simple and Fine Quality 
Weapons grant their wielder Moves that can only be used by a Trainer with a high enough Combat Rank.
That isn’t to say Combat has no use outside of battles. Opposed Combat Checks can be used for two characters 
grabbing at the same item or trying to push each other around without trying to seriously injure one another. One 
can also make use of the Combat Skill in martial arts performances or to break down obstacles with brute force.
Basic Martial Arts
Prerequisites: Novice Combat
Effect: You learn the Move Rock Smash.
Stamina
Prerequisites: Expert Athletics or Expert Combat
Effect: Whenever you Take a Breather or take Massive 
Damage or a Critical Hit, you gain Temporary Hit 
Points equal to your Athletics or Combat Rank after the 
triggering action has resolved.

Intimidate
Intimidate is a Body Skill that governs the use of scare tactics and 
coercion to force others to act in one’s favor.  It is a Skill that is 
lacking in subtlety compared to the other socially oriented Skills, 
but it can often compel results from otherwise unwilling parties 
where the others would fail. Expect to burn bridges and make no 
friends this way, however. 
Characters with a high Intimidate Rank tend to be physically 
imposing even when they’re silent and not acting.  They 
often find work as club bouncers and bodyguards. Gang 
leaders and ranking members of criminal organizations also tend to 
have high Intimidate Ranks. 
Common uses of Intimidate include scaring off wild Pokémon, bullying a guard 
into letting you through, and warding off potential muggers and pickpockets 
when walking through the shadier parts of town. Despite the often 
unsavory uses of the Skill, Intimidate is also often used to avoid violence 
and getting into a fight when it would be disadvantageous. 
Intimidate is not typically rolled as an Opposed Check. However, 
special circumstances may exist, such as a group of Trainers facing 
off against a criminal Team, with both of them trying to scare a 
pack of wild Pokémon into fighting on their side against the other. 
Intimidate may also be used in an Opposed Check against Focus to 
attempt to disrupt someone doing careful or difficult work. 
Beast Master
Prerequisite: Novice Intimidate
Effect: You may use Intimidate instead of Command to 
make Pokemon at 0 or 1 Loyalty obey your commands. 
You may also use Intimidate instead of Command 
to determine the limits and Bonus Experience from 
Training.
Intimidating Presence
Prerequisites: Novice Intimidate
Effect: You learn the Move Leer
Bad Mood
Prerequisites: Expert Intimidate
Effect: Your Critical Hit Range is increased by +1 if you 
are suffering from a Persistent Status Affliction. Your 
Critical Hit Range is increased by +1 if you are suffering 
from a Volatile Status Affliction. These stack with each 
other, giving a total of +2 to Critical Hit Range if you 
are suffering from both a Persistant and a Volatile Status 
Affliction.
Grace
Prerequisites: Novice Charm, Command, Guile, 
Intimidate, or Intuition
Effect: Your Pokémon may consume and benefit from 
2 more Poffins each. If this Pokémon is traded to a 
Trainer without the Grace feature, these extra dice from 
additional Poffins are not lost, but a Trainer without 
Grace may not benefit from more than 6 Dice gained 
from Poffins. You may always use any of the Skills that 
are prerequisites for Grace in the Introduction Stage of 
a Contest to roll for Contest Stat Dice of any kind. 
Demoralize
Prerequisites: Adept Intimidate
Effect: Whenever you land a Critical Hit on a foe, that 
foe becomes Vulnerable. Status-Class Moves with an 
Accuracy Roll can “Crit” for the purposes of activating 
this effect on a natural roll of 19 or higher, and any ef-
fects that expand your Critical-Hit Range also expand 
this range.

Stealth
Stealth is a Body Skill that represents a 
character’s ability to hide, sneak, and 
generally move and act undetected. 
Stealth is often associated with less 
than legal occupations, such as thieves 
and assassins, but characters with 
high Stealth Ranks could also easily 
act on the side of law enforcement or 
as field researchers studying reclusive 
or violent Pokémon. 
While the most common usage of 
Stealth is to move around unseen and 
unheard, the Skill also covers sleight 
of hand tricks and larceny, meaning 
it is tested when a character attempts 
to pickpocket someone or pick a 
lock. Acts of escape artistry and 
sleight of hand tricks also fall un-
der the purview of Stealth; for ex-
ample, characters may make use of 
the Skill to free themselves from bindings or slip out of a trap.
Stealth can be a lifesaver in dangerous situations, allowing a Trainer to ambush their foes or even sneak by them 
altogether. Even when these options are impossible, Stealth may be used to covertly perform reconaissance and 
gather information. 
In Opposed Checks, Stealth is, of course, almost always paired with Perception. However, an Opposed Check may 
be made between Stealth and an enemy’s crafting-related skill such as Technology Education or Occult Education 
if a character is attempting to slip out of magical restraints or open a lock another character constructed. 
Art of Stealth
Prerequisites: Expert Stealth
Effect: You gain the Stealth Capability.
Sneak’s Tricks
Prerequisites: Adept Stealth
Effect: You learn the Move Astonish.
Nimble Movement
Prerequisites: Adept Acrobatics or Stealth
Effect: Whenever you Disengage, you Shift 2 meters 
instead of 1. 
Slippery
Prerequisites: Novice Stealth
Effect: You may use your Stealth Skill when defending 
in Opposed Grapple, Push, or Trip checks. When Grap-
pling, if you win an Opposed Check when using Stealth, 
you must choose to end the Grapple (you cannot choose 
to gain Dominance).
Expert Trickster
Prerequisites: Adept Stealth
Effect: You gain a +2 Opposed Checks with all Dirty 
Trick Maneuvers. The “Once per Scene per Foe” 
Limitation of each Dirty Trick Maneuver is expended 
only upon successfully affecting a foe with that Dirty 
Trick Maneuver.

Survival
Apricorn Balls
Prerequisites: Novice Survival or Adept Technology
Effect: As an Extended Action, you may craft Apricorns 
into their corresponding Poké Ball. Use of this Feature 
requires access to a Poké Ball Tool Box.
Green Thumb
Prerequisites: Novice General Education or Novice 
Survival
Effect: You know how to grow Apricorns and Tier 1 
Berries using a Portable Grower or Fertilized Soil.
Traveler
Prerequisites: Novice Survival 
Effect: You may use Survival instead of Athletics and 
Acrobatics to determine your Power Capability, High 
Jump, and Long Jump values. Determine your Overland 
Movement by substituting your Survival Rank for the 
lower of your Athletics or Acrobatics Rank.
Paleontologist
Prerequisites: Novice Pokémon Education or Novice 
Survival 
Effect: You can identify fossils with a DC 10 Pokémon 
Education or Survival Check. You know how to operate 
Reanimation Machines and can use them to revive 
Fossils. See the “Pokémon Fossils” section (page 216) 
for more information.
Survival Drive
Prerequisites: Adept Survival
Effect: You learn the Move Bulk Up.
Survival is a Body Skill that governs all sorts of 
wilderness activities, from starting a fire, to building 
shelter, to making a trail through heavy brush and 
shrubbery. Characters with a high Survival Rank spend 
a lot of time outdoors. Pokémon Rangers and Trainers 
concerned with conservation efforts and Safari Zones 
tend to have high Survival Ranks. 
Survival can be used in almost any situation in the 
outdoors, whether it be navigating a snowstorm, 
foraging for food, or simply setting up camp for the 
night. It can be used to identify Mushrooms (page 281) 
that can be picked in the wild as well. 
A common use of Survival is to take half an hour or an 
hour to scout out an area and learn basic information 
about it – the common Pokémon of the area and what 
Apricorns or Berries are commonly found in it. For 
light density wilderness areas such as a savanna or small 
forest, the DC should be easy for anyone who’s invested 
in Survival – about a 12. Moderately complex ecosystems 
such as a foggy wetland may require a check of 16 or so. 
Denser or harsher areas of wilderness such as tropical 
rainforests or frigid arctic ecosystems may require a 
check of 20+. Succeeding by a margin of success of at 
least 4 should usually result in additional info, such as 
identifying signs of rare Pokémon or plants.
More than just finding the means to live in the wilds, 
Survival also covers geology and geography and enables 
a Trainer to search for useful items, such as Elemental 
Stones and Fossils (page 216). Spelunking also falls 
under the purview of Survival.
Survival can also be used to track someone through the 
wilderness. This is usually an Opposed Check between 
a Trainer’s Survival and their target’s Stealth. However, 
certain environments may make tracking easier or more 
difficult. Impose a circumstantial penalty to a target 
being tracked through a desert or to the tracker trying 
to find signs of movement through a dark gloomy cave. 
Despite counting as a Body Category Skill, Survival 
also counts as an Education Skill.

General Education
Green Thumb
Prerequisites: Novice General Education or Novice 
Survival
Effect: You know how to grow Apricorns and Tier 1 
Berries using a Portable Grower or Fertilized Soil.
Instruction
Prerequisite: Novice General Education
Effect:  Whenever you aid an ally in an Assisted Skill 
Check using an Education Skill you have at Novice 
Rank or higher, add your full Rank value as a bonus to 
their roll instead of half. 
Scholar
Prerequisites: Expert General Education
Effect: You gain a +1 Bonus to Skill Checks with General 
Education, Medicine Education, Occult Education, 
Pokémon Education, Technology Education, and 
Survival.
Groomer
Prerequisites: Novice Pokémon Education or Novice 
General Education
Effect: You know how to effectively groom your Pokémon 
with access to a Groomer’s Kit. You may groom up to 6 
Pokémon in one hour.  Grooming Pokémon may count 
as an hour of Training, and you may apply Experience 
Training, teach Poke-Edges, and apply any Features 
that could be applied during Training. If you apply 
Experience Training from Grooming, use your General 
Education or Pokémon Education Rank to determine 
Bonus Experience gained during Training. A Pokémon 
that has been Groomed also gains a +1d6 Bonus to the 
Introduction Roll of a Contest for the rest of the day.
General Education is a Mind Skill that covers well-
rounded academic learning. The universal coursework 
covered through mandatory schooling along with a 
liberal arts education are most representative of the 
General Education Skill. 
Characters with a high General Education Rank tend 
to be masters of trivia and local or regional knowledge, 
though they often have specializations in more narrow 
fields such as literature, history, and philosophy. It’s a 
good idea to think about a field of expertise or two to 
give the Skill more personal flavor.
Of course, General Education also encompasses basic 
training in mathematics, natural sciences, and other 
common fields. However, it’s safe to assume that most 
characters know the basics unless they have a Pathetic 
Rank in General Eduction.
General 
Education 
is most often tested 
when characters are 
faced with issues of 
politics and current 
events, 
such 
as 
knowing about the 
stances of local Gym 
Leaders or government officials on political issues or 
being familiar with the details of recent news stories. 
Knowledge of history is also a common usage; it can 
be useful to know that the reason a town is wary of the 
party is because they have a Camerupt with them and 
a pack of that Pokémon was responsible for devastating 
the town half a decade back. 
Another way to treat General Education is as a catch-all 
Skill for a particular setting, covering common issues 
that aren’t associated well with other Education Skills 
but are important to the setting. A campaign with a 
law enforcement focus might use General Education 
to cover police protocol and the law, while a wild west 
campaign might use General Education to cover dueling 
etiquette and other narrative standbys in frontier life. 
While General Education isn’t specialized in itself, it 
also represents a character’s skill in conducting research. 
Obviously, you should use more specific Education 
Skills instead when the sought after information is 
highly advanced or it is more relevant.
General Education, like most Education Skills, doesn’t 
have very many applications in Opposed Checks. At 
most, it might be used in a race determining who can 
research a specific piece of information first.

Medicine Education
Medicine Education is a Mind Skill that covers the 
science of healing and mending. It covers a wide range 
of situations, from performing first aid in the field to 
growing organs and limbs in a lab. Characters with a high 
Medicine Education Rank usually spend a significant 
amount of time studying Pokémon and human biology 
alike in order to effectively treat patients of all different 
species. 
While the damage and Injuries taken in combat in 
Pokémon Tabletop United typically don’t exceed flesh 
wounds, Medicine Education can certainly be used to 
treat more traumatic injuries that aren’t modeled in the 
mechanics, such as broken bones and infected wounds. 
While away from the conveniences of modern hospitals 
and Pokémon Centers, Medicine Education Checks 
may be necessary to construct a splint for a broken 
limb or to clean and dress a particularly nasty wound to 
avoid infection.
Beyond simply treating the wounds of battle, characters 
with training in Medicine Education are also useful 
when it comes to diagnosing diseases such as Pokérus 
or perhaps ailments stemming from malformed 
Evolutionary Stones and the dangerous radiation they 
might give off. 
In some extreme cases, characters may have to not only 
diagnose these ailments but invent new treatments 
altogether to deal with them. The process of medical 
research and inventing new medications is of course 
governed by Medicine Education. 
Outside of treatment and diagnosis, Medicine Education 
represents broader projects of biology intended to 
further understanding of Pokémon and human bodies 
and even enhance them. Although this is usually 
limited to higher tech settings, Medicine Education can 
certainly be used to conduct gene therapy or produce 
other biological augmentations. Other more blatantly 
“mad science” projects may require complex steps with 
Medicine Education Checks involved along the way.
Characters with sufficient training in Medicine 
Education can operate devices called Wonder Launchers 
which allow them to administer combat drugs to their 
Pokémon from a distance. 
Medic Training
Prerequisites: Novice Medicine Education
Effect: When you use Restorative Items on others, they 
do not forfeit their next turn.
Repel Crafter
Prerequisites: Novice Medicine or Technology Edu
Effect: Create a Repel for $100 or a Super Repel for 
$150. Requires access to a Chemistry Set.

Occult Education
Occult Education is a Mind Skill that governs knowledge 
of all types of supernatural lore and phenomena. 
Characters with a high Occult Education Rank can have 
incredibly varied interests and areas of expertise, and 
this is often dependent on the specific campaign. 
Much of the knowledge that falls under Occult 
Education is particularly esoteric and unknown to the 
public at large. This can range from passed down tales 
of Legendary Pokémon and ancient places of power in 
the world to the functioning of supernatural powers 
such as Aura Reading and Psychic powers. 
While other Skills may govern the use of those powers, 
in this case Intuition and Focus respectively, Occult 
Education can be thought of as the science that studies 
how and why those powers function.
Some situations where Occult Education might be 
tested include studying magical ancient ruins such as 
the Ruins of Alph, researching lore about long-forgotten 
Legendary Pokémon, or studying a strange Psychic 
phenomenon or malformed Aura in a location.
These can be common occurrences in one campaign but 
rare in another. Whether or not the Occult Education 
Skill sees common use varies by campaign to campaign, 
so it’s a good idea for the players and GM to talk about 
this before characters are created. 
Not only will it vary whether or not Occult Education is 
widely used as a Skill, but the particular function of the 
Skill will vary as well. In one campaign, occultists would 
be expected to be knowledgeable about ancient ruins, 
while in another, ancient ruins may be largely mundane 
while Legendary Pokémon are the focus of occult stud-
ies. Characters developed around Occult Education 
tend to have widely ranging specializations, and it is a 
good idea to discuss not only if the Occult Education 
skill will be useful in general but whether a character’s 
area of expertise is relevant to a campaign.
The Occult Education Skill is also closely associated 
with Ghost Type Pokémon and their unique capabilities, 
such as turning invisible and phasing through walls. As 
such, Occult Education is tested when a Trainer applies 
a Cleanse Tag to ward against phantasmal intruders, 
and it also allows Cleanse Tags to be used to remove 
several of the Status Afflictions that Ghost Types often 
inflict (page 302). 
Additionally, Occult Education is used in the operation 
of Dowsing Rods (page 284), which Trainers use to find 
energized Shards that are used for a variety of crafting 
purposes. 
Occult Education is such a varied 
Skill that it is 
often difficult to nail down its 
uses in Opposed Checks. 
However, when two sides 
are competing for control 
of an arcane artifact or 
enacting rituals involving 
the Unown or other 
mystical Pokémon, 
Opposed 
Occult 
Education 
Checks 
could be called for.
Gem Lore
Prerequisites: Novice Occult Education
Effect: As an Extended Action, you may turn a Shard 
into a Gem of one of its associated Types. Additionally, 
you can turn 4 Red Shards into a Fire Stone; 4 Blue 
Shards into a Water Stone; 4 Yellow Shards into a 
Thunder Stone; 4 Orange Shards into a Shiny Stone; 4 
Green Shards into a Leaf Stone; or 4 Violet Shards into a 
Dusk Stone. You can also destroy any of these six Stones 
to gain 4 Shards of the corresponding color.
Tag Scribe
Prerequisites: Novice Occult Education
Special - Extended Action
Effect: You create a Cleanse Tag. This may be used a 
number of times each day equal to half your Occult 
Education Rank.

Pokémon Education
Pokémon Education is a Mind Skill that governs one’s knowledge about Pokémon. This ranges from simple practical 
knowledge such as the diets and caretaking needs of various species to more specialized scientific topics such as 
Pokémon Evolution and the biology of unusual Pokémon species. 
In a world where many institutions are entirely built around the use of Pokémon, it makes sense that they are the 
focus of much academic research. Pokémon Education is immensely useful in the field when encountering wild 
Pokémon, of course, and it can be used to understand their behavior patterns, needs, and their means of attack and 
weaknesses. Being well-versed in Pokémon Education can mean the difference between recognizing the signs of 
an Ursaring’s marked territory and stumbling into the cave of an angry bear.
Dedicated Pokémon battlers also obviously have uses for Pokémon Education. While Type Effectiveness, a 
Pokémon’s Types, and basic information about how their Stats lean or what kinds of Moves they prefer is considered 
to be common knowledge for anyone without Pathetic Rank Pokémon Education, more detailed information 
that one would find in the Pokédex such as when specific Moves are learned will generally require 
higher Ranks in Pokémon Education to recall from memory. 
When new Pokémon species are discovered, or variants of existing species come to 
light, Pokémon Education can be tested to learn about their traits or at least 
make educated guesses. In more everyday situations, it can be used to identify 
which Pokémon species are involved in a situation, such as discerning from 
claw marks left on a shed door what kinds of Pokémon have been breaking into 
a village’s food supply. 
Breeders also make use of Pokémon Education to keep track of their work, as the 
Skill can be tested to identify the species of Pokémon eggs.
Breeder
Prerequisites: Novice Pokémon Education 
Effect: If you are able to give two Pokémon that are 
compatible for breeding at least 4 hours of time alone, 
you may make a Pokémon Education Check with a DC 
of 12. If you succeed, the Pokémon are guaranteed to 
produce an egg if you give them an additional 4 hours.
Paleontologist
Prerequisites: Novice Pokémon Education or Novice 
Survival  
Effect: You can identify fossils with a DC 10 Pokémon 
Education or Survival Check. You know how to operate 
Reanimation Machines and can use them to revive 
Fossils. See the “Pokémon Fossils” section (page 216) 
for more.
Groomer
Prerequisites: Novice Pokémon Education or Novice 
General Education
Effect: You know how to effectively groom your Pokémon 
with access to a Groomer’s Kit. You may groom up to 6 
Pokémon in one hour.  Grooming Pokémon may count 
as an hour of Training, and you may apply Experience 
Training, teach Poke-Edges, and apply any Features 
that could be applied during Training. If you apply 
Experience Training from Grooming, use your General 
Education or Pokémon Education Rank to determine 
Bonus Experience gained during Training. A Pokémon

Balls for $175. Requires access to a Poké Ball Tool Box.
Poké Ball Repair
Prerequisites: Basic Balls or Apricorn Balls
Effect: You may attempt to fix any Poké Ball that 
has failed to capture a Pokémon and broke. Make a 
Technology Check with a DC of 15. If you succeed, the 
Poké Ball is fixed and is treated as if it had not broken. If 
you fail, the ball is permanently broken. Requires access 
to a Poké Ball Tool Box.
Repel Crafter
Prerequisites: Novice Medicine or Technology Edu
Effect: Create a Repel for $100 or a Super Repel for 
$150. Requires access to a Chemistry Set.
Technology Education is a Mind Skill that governs the creation and use of machines and technology, ranging from 
the ubiquitous Poké Ball to computers and vehicles. Characters with a high Technology Education Rank tend to 
have many gadgets and can easily find their way around a factory, engineering workshop, or chemistry lab. 
Mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering are the main fields covered by Technology Education, but 
materials science and computer science also fall under its purview. However, important to note is that Technology 
Education largely deals with the inorganic. Biology, organic chemistry, and similar fields are better 
suited to the Medicine Education Skill. Even if gene therapy treatments might require advanced 
technology, they don’t primarily concern themselves with machines or chemicals and don’t fall 
under Technology Education.
Some situations that call for Technology Education include repairing a vehicle 
or piece of machinery, cracking electronic locks or hacking into computer 
databases, and building a custom piece of equipment such as an octopus arm 
backpack. The world of Pokémon also includes specialty pieces of 
technology such as Snag Machines and Dream Machines which 
would require Technology Education to maintain.
Criminal Teams often make a habit of creating technological 
superweapons, and the Technology Education Skill helps in understanding 
and shutting down those systems. 
In addition, many modern traps are technological in nature.  Laser tripwires, proximity sensors, 
IR cameras, and mines are all part of a modern security arsenal. Dealing with or deploying such 
security measures is the source of most Opposed Checks using the Technology Education 
Skill. 
What exactly the Technology Education Skill covers will also vary depending on the 
time period of the campaign. While driving a car and operating basic computers and 
electronics are common knowledge in modern times, these activities may be limited to those with the appropriate 
Technology Education Rank in historical settings. 
On a final note, most Trainer options using Technology Education are found in our sci-fi sourcebook, Do Porygon 
Dream of Mareep?. Players and GMs are encouraged to look there for building gadgeteer and tech whiz characters!

from Poffins. You may always use any of the Skills that 
are prerequisites for Grace in the Introduction Stage of 
a Contest to roll for Contest Stat Dice of any kind.

Expert Manipulator
Prerequisites: Adept Guile
Effect: You gain a +2 Opposed Checks with all 
Manipulate Maneuvers. The “Once per Scene per 
Foe” Limitation of each Manipulate Maneuver is 
expended only upon succesfully affecting a foe with that 
Manipulate Maneuver.
Confidence Artist
Prerequisites: Novice Guile
Effect: You learn the Move Confide.
Guile is a Mind Skill that governs lying, manipulation, 
and general deception and subterfuge. Characters with 
a high Guile Rank think quickly on their feet and are 
usually clever and witty in conversation. 
The most common use of Guile is to lie convincingly. 
Lying with confidence and spinning believable yarns has 
many applications, of course, ranging from convincing 
a guard you have the right security clearance but left 
your ID at home to fooling a cop into thinking they saw 
someone else breaking into that house.
Aside from the obvious application, Guile also covers 
a range of acting skills, from faking emotions to 
pretending to be someone else entirely. Someone armed 
with a high Guile Rank and a spare Team Rocket uniform 
could probably bluff their way into a secret hideout 
or learn the secrets of the criminal organization. This 
application of Guile goes beyond blunt deception into 
subtle manipulation as well, allowing a smooth talker to 
use carefully worded half-truths and targeted prods at a 
victim’s beliefs and passions to get what they want.
Whereas Stealth would be used to hide from someone’s 
vision or hearing, Guile is often used to “hide in plain 
sight”, such as when blending into a crowd to tail 
someone through a busy city. Even when there’s no 
hiding place around, someone with high Guile might 
be able to pose as an innocuous passerby or fast-talk 
their way out of suspicion.
Guile can also be thought of as a streetwise Skill, 
representing how well a character can read into situations 
on the street, gather information, and cut deals. Guile 
can help someone haggle on the black market, tell 
the difference between an undercover cop and a real 
seller or buyer of illicit goods, and realize when they’ve 
stepped somewhere they really don’t belong. 
Uses of Guile aren’t limited to just human interactions 
either. Faced with a hostile wild Pokémon that won’t 
be scared away, a Trainer with a high Guile Rank may 
attempt to trick it into a trap or distract it long enough 
to mount an escape.
Opposed checks pitting Guile against Guile might be 
used in a duel of wits, but far more common is when 
Guile is rolled against Intuition to decide whether or 
not someone sees through another’s 
lies. Perception may also be rolled 
against Guile when attempting to see 
through a disguise.

Perception
Perception is a Mind Skill that represents a character’s 
awareness of their environment and attention to detail. 
Characters with a high Perception Rank have not only 
honed senses but a trained mind that knows where to 
look for details others would normally miss. 
Perception is tested whenever your character is faced 
with a situation where they could miss a crucial detail 
in their surroundings. Some examples of this include 
finding a carefully laid trap in Team Rocket’s hideout, 
spotting a Stunfisk buried in the mud, and turning up 
bloody Pokémon fur and feathers in the corner of a 
crime scene. 
Oftentimes, Perception is a reactive Skill, one that the 
GM calls a Skill Check for rather than being initiated by 
a player’s actions. Naturally, if only the GM knows about 
the ambush lying in wait for the PCs, then they have to 
tell the players to make the Skill Checks to discover it.
Active investigation often uses the Perception 
Skill as well, such as when a detective is rifling 
through someone’s drawers looking for 
evidence of a crime or when characters 
scouring an ancient ruin check a 
room meticulously for traps.
Perception is by far one of 
the most often used Skills in 
Pokémon Tabletop United, 
and nearly every type of 
character can benefit from 
an improved awareness 
of 
the 
world 
around 
them. 
However, 
just 
Perception 
alone 
can’t 
solve all problems; it often 
takes 
other 
specialized 
knowledge Skills to make 
sense of the details that a 
hawk-eyed character spots. 
For example, a character with high Perception might 
easily spot the Unown-like inscriptions on the bottom 
of a dusty clay goblet’s rim, but they might need to 
consult someone trained in Occult Education to make 
sense of them. Traps and hidden locks might stand out 
with high Perception but be otherwise impossible to 
deal with without investment in the Stealth Skill. 
The most common Opposed Check using Perception 
is against Stealth, when one character tries to hide 
from another. Perception is also often tested alongside 
Acrobatics as an option for situations where it’s 
important to determine which character reacts faster to 
a surprising or sudden event.

Charm
Charm is a Spirit Skill that represents how persuasive a 
character is and how likable they can make themselves 
seem to others. Characters with a high Charm Rank are 
charismatic and warm, always knowing what to say to 
draw people closer to them. 
Making people agree with and like you obviously has 
many uses. Charm can get you into places that would 
otherwise bar you entry, help you haggle down prices, 
and aid in cutting beneficial deals for you and your 
companions. Charm is the Skill of diplomacy and 
forging positive and constructive relationships. 
This is, of course, not limited to humans. The Charm 
Skill is used to improve the disposition of wild Pokémon 
and can potentially be used to prevent conflict, seek help 
while traveling, or gain access to precious resources 
such as Berry Groves (page 215).
Remember that while Charm is a single Skill, it can 
cover many different approaches to the same end. 
Seduction, flattery, and emotional appeals are just a few 
of the strategies that characters might employ to Charm 
their targets to their side. 
Charm is rarely rolled as part of an Opposed Check. 
Usually, when it is applied against an NPC, the GM 
will simply set a static DC rather than opposing it with 
another Skill. In rare circumstances, you may wish 
to compare how persuasive one character is versus 
another when there is a third party evaluating both 
sides’ arguments.

Train the Reserves
Prerequisites: Novice Command
Effect: You may apply Experience Training to a number

stead of equal to your Command Rank. 
Note: Beast Master or Groomer do not change the Skill

Leader
Prerequisites: Adept Command
Effect: You learn the Move After You.
Trainer of Champions
Prerequisites: Expert Command
Effect: Whenever you apply Experience Training to a 
Pokemon, they gain an additional +5 Experience.
Command is a Spirit Skill representing a character’s 
ability to lead and inspire. Command is about having 
presence and being seen and listened to. Characters 
with a high Command Rank can become the center of 
attention in a room with a few well-chosen words. 
The most obvious and common use of the Command 
Skill is in giving orders to Pokémon and particularly 
retaining control of unruly or untamed Pokémon. 
For example, Pokémon with Loyalty 0 or 1 require 
Command checks to successfully order them in battle 
(page 210).
Expanding on this notion, a Trainer’s Command 
Rank also affects their ability to train their Pokémon 
in downtime outside of combat. The higher their 
Command Rank, the more effective their training (page 
202). 
Outside of Pokémon-related applications, Command 
has a number of uses. Command is tested when trying 
to disperse a riot or when directing a panicking crowd 
to safety in the aftermath of a Team Rocket terrorist 
attack. For Pokémon Rangers and other members of 
law enforcement, Command may be necessary to keep 
subordinates in line, especially rebellious elements, 
similar to low Loyalty Pokémon. 
During combat, Command also lets a Trainer help their 
allies Take a Breather and recover from Status Afflictions 
such as Confusion and Rage (page 245).
Command doesn’t have to relate to explicitly giving 
orders either. It can be used to gain presence and 
attention in a scene or give an impression of authority 
without issuing directives. For example, while Charm 
may often be tested when giving speeches to a crowd to 
win them over to an idea, a character who wants to make 
a show of a community’s solidarity and the strength of 
its leadership during a time of crisis might roll their 
Command Skill instead when delivering a speech.
In Opposed Checks, Command may be used against a 
foe’s Intimidate to keep a crowd or a squad of allies from 
falling to fear and panic. Command is also tested to help 
snap allies out of supernatural mental influences, such 
as powerful  Legendary Pokémon or Ghost and Psychic 
Types. In these cases, roll Command against the foe’s 
relevant Skill, usually Focus or Intimidate.

Focus
Focus is a Spirit Skill that represents a character’s ability 
to concentrate on difficult or complex tasks or to work 
under pain and stress. It can be thought of as analogous 
to willpower, and characters with a high Focus Rank 
are often intensely driven and ambitious, or at the least 
unshakable once they’ve dedicated themselves to a task.
The most common uses of Focus come into play 
when it’s rolled alongside a use of another Skill to test 
how well you can concentrate on the other task. For 
example, it may be a Stealth Check to pick a lock, but 
if a character was suffering from the painful venomous 
bite of a Seviper on their hand, they might also need 
to test Focus to keep steady and concentrated on the 
task. A complicated maneuver such as jumping into 
the air, throwing a knife to hit a specific target, then 
teleporting to a platform mid-air and pulling a lever 
at an exact timing when landing would also call for a 
Focus Check in addition to the Acrobatics Check that 
would be invoked.
Some tasks might require Focus Checks by their very 
nature, even if they’re not excessively complicated. 
Disarming a bomb, for example, would almost always 
call for a Focus Check due to the stress of the situation. 
Another example is when performing delicate actions 
under the stress of being attacked in combat (page 245). 
These actions always require a Focus Check.
Focus is also closely associated with a number of 
supernatural abilities. The Telepathy and Telekinetic 
Capabilities run off of the user’s Focus Rank, for 
example (page 308). In general, Focus is used for 
resisting supernatural mental influence as well, such 
as possession by powerful Ghosts. This is usually an 
Opposed Check against the foe’s Focus Skill. 
Even outside of supernatural influences, emotions can 
disrupt someone’s ability to act in tip-top condition. 
Focus is tested to keep self-control in the face of very 
strong fear, anger, or other volatile emotions. Focus is 
often used in an Opposed Check against Intimidate in 
this context, to continue acting under duress. 
Basic Psionics
Prerequisites: Elemental Connection (Psychic)

Intuition
Intuition is a Spirit Skill that represents one’s reliability 
when making decisions from the gut or gaining insights 
into a situation through instinct. Intuition can often 
be thought of as encompassing common sense, and 
characters with a high Intuition Rank will often find 
themselves making the right decision on a hunch 
without necessarily understanding why. 
In addition, Intuition governs empathy and reading 
emotions, the interpretation of body language, and 
other unspoken social cues. Intuition is tested when 
attempting to discern someone’s emotional state or tell 
whether or not they are lying or being deceitful. This 
makes Intuition crucial for Trainers with aspirations of 
joining law enforcement or getting involved in politics. 
When presented with many clues and small bits of 
information about a situation, a Trainer can call on their 
Intuition Skill to try to discern connections between 
the clues and filter out relevant data from the irrelevant. 
Investigative characters such as detectives and spies 
would do well to train their Intuition for this reason. 
Finally, a number of artistic endeavors and practical 
skills fall under Intuition, such as cooking. While 
recipes can usually guarantee a good result, the true test 
of a chef is in how well they can intuitively assemble 
dishes from a variety of ingredients. Painting and other 
non-performance arts are covered by Intuition, and the 
interpretation of those arts and reading into an artist’s 
intent are as well. 
In Opposed Checks, Intuition is most often rolled 
against Guile to test if a character can see past another’s 
deception. 
Basic Cooking
Prerequisites: Novice Intuition
Effect: You may create “Candy Bars” or “Baby Food” 
with cooking ingredients costing  50. You may fluff the 
food in any reasonable manner you like.
Mystic Senses

Intimidate, or Intuition
Effect: Your Pokémon may consume and benefit from 
2 more Poffins each. If this Pokémon is traded to a 
Trainer without the Grace feature, these extra dice from 
additional Poffins are not lost, but a Trainer without 
Grace may not benefit from more than 6 Dice gained 
from Poffins. You may always use any of the Skills that 
are prerequisites for Grace in the Introduction Stage of 
a Contest to roll for Contest Stat Dice of any kind. 
Instinctive Aptitude
Prerequisite: Adept Intuition
Effect: Whenever you spend AP to raise your roll on 
an Accuracy Roll or Skill Check, you get a +2 bonus 
instead of +1. This cannot be used on Rolls made by 
your Pokémon.

Edges
The following is the list of Edges. You gain 4 Edges during character creation, another at every even Level, and 
additional Edges with restricted uses at every Level at which your maximum Skill Rank increases.
Most likely, the vast majority of Edges will be to increase Skill Ranks, but there are a variety of Edges that can be 
taken based on other prerequisites. In a way, however, all of these Edges will relate to ways of advancing your Skills, 
whether in broader ways such as increasing Skill Ranks, or in more specific ways such as developing a particular 
weapon technique to hone your Combat or learning to ride Pokémon better as a narrow focus of Athletics or 
Acrobatics. Edges are much like mini-Features, but unlike Features always Static and have relatively simple 
prerequisites. Some Edges can only be gained at character creation, or with your GM’s permission. 
Skill Edges
Basic Skills
Prerequisites: None
Effect: You Rank Up a Skill from Pathetic to Untrained, 
or Untrained to Novice. You may take this Edge multiple 
times.
Adept Skills
Prerequisites: Level 2
Effect: You Rank Up a Skill from Novice to Adept. You 
may take this Edge multiple times.
Expert Skills
Prerequisites: Level 6
Effect: You Rank Up a Skill from Adept to Expert. You

that skill under those circumstances, you may choose to 
roll one less dice, and instead add +6 to the result.  You 
may take this Edge multiple times, choosing a different 
circumstance each time. 
Cast’s Note: Obviously, Skill Stunt is subject to GM 
approval, but it is a neat way to develop a 
character’s niche. GMs should feel free to bar 
players from taking it for activities that are 
too vague, too frequent, or too easily taken advantage of 
(eg: Perception to notice hidden objects). 
Categoric Inclination
Prerequisites: None
Effect: Choose Body, Mind, or Spirit. You gain a +1 
Bonus to all Skill Checks of that Category.
Skill Enhancement
Prerequisites: None
Effect: Choose two different Skills. You gain a +2 bonus 
to each of those skills. Skill Enhancement may be taken 
multiple times, but the bonus may be applied only once 
to a particular skill.
Virtuoso
Prerequisites: A Skill at Master Rank, Level 20
Effect: Choose a Skill at Master Rank. Consider that Skill 
to be effectively “Rank 8” for any Features or effects that 
depend on Skill Rank. Virtuoso may be taken multiple 
times, but you must choose a different Skill each time.

Features
How to Read Features
Features are what truly define a character and what they are good at. Thus, understanding your features is critical 
to playing the game. Below is an example Feature that has been labeled:
Ace Trainer (Feature Name)
[Class] (Tags)
Prerequisites: Novice Command, a [Training] Feature (Prerequisites)
Drain 1 AP – Extended Action (Frequency and Action)
Trigger: You spend at least half an hour training your Pokémon (Trigger or Target)
Effect: For each Pokémon that has been trained during this time, choose a Stat besides HP; that Stat becomes 
Trained until an Extended Rest is taken.  The default State of Trained Stats is +1 Combat Stages instead of 0. A 
Pokémon may have only one Trained Stat at a time. (Effect) 
Note: Just to clarify, this Feature Drains 1 AP per training session, not per Pokémon. So train as many as you can 
to get the most out of this Feature! (Notes)
The Feature Name is simply the name of the Feature, 
of course.
The [TAGS] under each Feature convey important 
information. The “Ace Trainer” Feature only has one 
tag: [CLASS] which indicates it is a Class Feature. More 
information about tags in the next section.
The Prerequisites list the minimum requirements 
needed to take that feature. Often these requirements 
are other Features, or Skill Ranks. For example, your 
Command Skill must be at Novice or higher, and you 
must have a [Training] Feature to take Ace Trainer. 
Some Features require “X [Class Name] Features”. This 
means you need at least X Features from that Class. The 
“Base” Feature counts towards this total.
Frequency and Action determines how often a Feature 
may be performed and what kind of action is required 
to perform them. The “Ace Trainer” Feature is “Drain 
1 AP – Extended Action” which means it can be 
performed At-Will as long as you Drain 1 AP and are 
out of combat and have enough time. See page 227 for 
more information on types of actions.
However, it also has a Trigger which specifies when 
you may activate the feature. Some features instead list 
a Target which means it can be used any time on the 
specified targets. Others have a Condition that must be 
met in order t use the Feature
Frequencies that you may see include:
»»
At-Will – which simply means you may use the 
Feature as much as you’re able!
»»
Static which means the Feature is passive and always 
in effect.
»»
Time X, which simply means you can perform that 
Feature X times per mentioned amount of Time. 
Times include “Scene”, “Daily”, or even “One Time 
Use”. For example Daily is once a day, and Scene x2 
is twice a Scene. 
»»
X AP – These Features may be performed At-Will, 
but you must pay X Action Points to do so.
»»
Bind X AP – These Features have an effect as long 
as X AP are “Bound” and unable to be used. They 
can be Unbound and the AP freed on your turn as 
a Free Action.
»»
Drain X AP – like X AP, except AP spent on these 
Features is “Drained” and does not recover until 
you take an Extended Rest.
The Effect Line simply details the effect of the feature.
Crafting Features may be formatted a bit differently 
than other Features. They generally include a Cost 
or Ingredient line instead of Frequency.  Crafting 
Features, unless stated otherwise, have a Frequency of 
At-Will, and are an Extended Action. These Features 
may indicate equipment necessary to use the Feature.
Finally, Features often have clarifying Notes. A Single 
Feature cannot be taken multiple times, unless otherwise 
stated by its effect, or unless it has the [Ranked X] tag.

This page is important, and you 
should read it.

Feature Tags
Many Features have one or more Tags under the Feature Name. These are a list of the tags that may appear.
[Class] – Unlike in many other game systems, such 
as Dungeons and Dragons, your “Classes” are simply 
special Features that you can take as you are able to 
qualify for them. These Features are the beginnings of a 
chain of many other Features. A Trainer may only have 
a maximum of 4 Class Features.
[+Stat] – Features with this tag increase a Stat by one 
point; for example, a Feature might read as [+Attack]. 
This Tag is usually found on Features related to Combat 
or in Combat-related Classes. 
[Ranked X] – A Feature with the Ranked Tag can be 
taken up to X Times. Each time you take a new rank, 
follow the directions in the listed effect. Latter Ranks 
by default always require any previous ranks. Each time 
you Rank Up a ranked feature, this counts as gaining a 
new Feature; thus you apply any [Tags], and may count 
each Rank for the purposes of prerequisites that require 
a certain number of class Features.
[Branch] – If on a [Class] Feature, this tag means that 
Feature may be taken multiple times using a Class slot 
and choosing a different specialization each time. All 
other Features under this class with the [Branch] tag 
may be taken again with other instances of the Class, 
and function under their new Specialization.
[Orders] – This tag signifies these Features as Orders. 
Orders can only be given when the user is capable 
of communication with their Pokémon; usually this 
requires verbal communication unless other means of 
communication have been previously established (such 
as training your Pokémon to respond to visual cues). 
[Order] Features are almost always League Legal, and 
the user usually cannot target themselves with [Orders]. 
Exceptions to both of these rules will be noted. [Orders] 
are always Priority (Limited) actions. 
[Training] – You may choose to use Training Features 
as either a [Training] or an [Orders] Feature; it never 
has both tags at once when used.
 
You may use it as a [Training] Feature as an Extended 
Action after you spend at least half an hour training 
your Pokémon. If you do, the effect applies to any of the 
Pokémon Trained, and lasts until the end of your next 
Extended Rest. A Pokémon can be under the effect of 
only one Training Regime at a time this way.
 
However, these Features may also be used as [Orders] as 
a Standard Action. When used as [Orders], this applies 
only to one of your Pokémon, and lasts only until the 
beginning of your next turn. When used as [Orders], 
they may stack with the effects of any active [Training] 
(whether the [Orders] be for Training of the same 
Feature, or a different Feature).
[Stratagem] – These Features are special Orders which 
are activated once and then have a persistent effect 
while AP is bound. [Stratagem] Features may only be 
bound during combat and automatically unbind when 
combat ends. Only one [Stratagem] may be bound by a 
Pokémon at a given time. 
When using a [Stratagem] on multiple targets, each AP 
Bind is paid separately and may be released separately 
as well.
[Weapon] – Features with this tag make use of Weap-
ons in some way, often allowing the user to gain extra 
effects when wielding a Weapon.
Doxy: An easy way to keep track of Branching Classes is to mark each Feature down by the specialization it’s 
currently applying to. For example, if you take Stat Ace and select Defense and then later take Stat Ace 
again and select Special Defense, when you take Stat Link or any other Feature, mark it on your sheet 
as “Stat Link (Defense)” or “Stat Link (Special Defense)”.

General Features
These Features are available to all Trainers as long they meet the prerequisites and are not contained as part of a 
Trainer Class. They are separated into several categories, just like Edges are. 
Command Versatility
Prerequisites: Adept Command, Guile, or Pokémon 
Education
1 AP – Free Action
Trigger: Your Pokémon takes its turn.
Effect: Your Pokémon may give up use of a Scene or 
Daily Move to regain use of a Scene or Daily Move 
which it has already used. Your Pokémon may give up 
use of a Daily Move to regain use of a Scene Move, but 
not vice-versa. You may use Command Versatility only 
once per Scene per Pokémon.
Press 
Prerequisites: Adept Intimidate
At-Will – Standard Action
Target: Your own Pokémon.
Effect: You hit your Pokémon, and they lose 1/6th of 
their Max Hit Points and are cured of Sleep. Raise any 
two of their Stats by +1 CS each, and you may add half 
of your Intimidate Rank to any Skill Checks made this 
round to make this Pokémon obey orders. Using Press 
on a Pokémon may make them dislike you.
Quick Switch
Prerequisites: Novice Acrobatics or Novice Guile
2 AP – Free Action
Trigger: Your Pokémon Faints; or an opponent sends 
out a Pokémon
Effect: You may return and send out a Pokémon as a 
Free Action. You may perform this Feature on your turn 
without a Trigger. Pokémon sent out by Quick Switch 
cannot trigger another trainer’s Quick Switch. When 
you swap Pokémon using Quick Switch, you do not lose 
a Pokémon turn.
Species Savant
Prerequisites: 3 different individual Pokémon of the 
same evolutionary line.
Static
Effect: When you take Species Savant, choose a single 
Evolutionary Family. Your Pokémon of your Chosen 
Evolutionary Family have each of their Base Stats 
increased by +1. 
Tutoring
Prerequisites: Novice General Education, Special (See 
Effect)
One Time Use x 3 – Extended Action
Effect: When activating this Feature, select a Move 
known either by yourself or by 3 Pokémon you own. 
This Move is Mastered. As an Extended Action, you 
may have Pokémon spend 2 Tutor Points to learn a 
Move you have Mastered. Pokémon targeted this way 
can only learn Moves that they could learn by Level Up, 
TM, Egg Move, or Move Tutor. You may take Tutoring 
multiple times, each time gaining 3 uses of the Feature.
Note: To be clear, this Feature lets you choose a total of 
three different Moves you can Tutor. The use limitation 
isn’t on how often you can Tutor them; once you have 
Mastered a Move, you can Tutor it At-Will.
Pokémon Raising and Battling Features


## Page 60

Pokémon Training and Order Features
These Features are also used in the raising and battling of Pokémon but have special rules associated with them – 
all of them have the [Orders] tag or are Features that manipulate other Features with this tag.
Commander’s Voice
Prerequisites: Two Features with the [Orders] tag
Static
Effect: You may give two different [Orders] as a single 
Standard Action, or you may give one set of [Orders] as 
a Swift Action. 
Special: If this is used to use Focused Command and 
another [Order] that has targets, the second Order 
applies to both Pokémon you are commanding that 
turn. Commander’s Voice doesn’t allow you to use 
Focused Command as a Swift Action. 
Focused Command
[Orders]
Prerequisites: Master Command, one of Focus, Guile, 
Intimidate, or Pokémon Education at Expert
At-Will – Standard Action + Swift Action
Effect: You may have a second Pokémon take a turn this 
round, but both Pokémon can only take At-Will actions 
that round. Additionally, both Pokémon receive a -5 
Penalty on all Damage Rolls. You may pay 1 AP at the 
beginning of the round to lift the Frequency Restriction 
OR the Damage Penalty for the remainder of the round, 
or pay 2 AP to lift both.
Note: Focused Command has no targets, which may be 
relevant to certain Features which refer to [Orders]
Training Features: The following four Features are special types of Orders which can also be used to train your 
Pokémon outside of battle. They have special rules noted on the Feature Tags page that will be repeated here. 
You may choose to use Training Features as either a [Training] or an [Orders] Feature; it never has both tags at 
once when used.
 
You may use it as a [Training] Feature as an Extended Action after you spend at least an hour training your 
Pokémon. If you do, the effect applies to any of the Pokémon Trained, and lasts until the end of your next Extended 
Rest. A Pokémon can be under the effect of only one Training Regime at a time this way.
 
However, these Features may also be used as [Orders] as a Standard Action. When used as [Orders], this applies 
only to one of your Pokémon, and lasts only until the beginning of your next turn. When used as [Orders], they 
may stack with the effects of any active [Training] (whether the [Orders] be for Training of the same Feature, or a 
different Feature).
Agility Training
[Training] [Orders]
Prerequisites: Novice Athletics, Untrained Command
At-Will – Special 
Effect: The target becomes Agile until the end of the 
effect duration. Agile Pokémon gain a +1 bonus to 
Movement Capabilities and +4 to Initiative.
Brutal Training
[Training] [Orders]
Prerequisites: Novice Intimidate, Untrained Command
At-Will – Special 
Effect: The target becomes Brutal until the end of the 
effect duration. Brutal Pokémon increase the Critical-
Hit and Effect Range of all attacks by +1. 
Focused Training
[Training] [Orders]
Prerequisites: Novice Command
At-Will – Special 
Effect: The target becomes Focused until the end of the 
effect duration. Focused Pokémon gain a +1 bonus to 
Accuracy Rolls and +2 to Skill Checks.

[Training] [Orders]
Prerequisites: Novice Charm, Untrained Command
At-Will – Special 
Effect: The target becomes Inspired until the end of the 
effect duration.  Inspired Pokémon gain a +1 bonus to 
Evasion and +2 to Save Checks.

[Stratagem] Features are special Orders which are activated once and then have a persistent effect while AP is 
Bound. [Stratagem] Features may only be Bound during combat and automatically Unbind when combat ends. 
Only one [Stratagem] may be Bound by a Pokémon at a given time. 
When using a [Stratagem] on multiple targets, each AP Bind is paid separately and may be released separately as 
well.
Ravager Orders

Static
Effect: You gain the Reckless Advance and Strike Again! 
Orders. 
Reckless Advance
[Orders] [Stratagem]

damage rolls of the target’s damaging melee attacks by

full round.

value.
Long Shot
[Orders]
Scene x2 – Standard Action
Target: Your Pokémon
Effect: The target’s damaging ranged attacks have their 
range doubled until the end of their next turn, and deal 
X additional damage. X is equal to the distance in meters 
that the attack traveled. Long Shot does not increase the 
size of area of effect attacks. If attacks altered by Long 
Shot are Critical Hits, add the value of the Damage Dice 
Roll an additional time to the total damage.
Orders, Training Features, and Trainer Classes
A number of Trainer Classes have their own Orders, or Features which are reliant on Orders and Training Features 
to function. Because the effectiveness of using some of these Classes is often reliant on choosing other Order-
related Features for them to use, we’re putting a list of all such Classes and their Features which are either Orders 
or somehow synergize with Orders and Training Features in one place for you to easily browse.
Ace Trainer: Elite Trainer, Critical Moment
Channeler: Battle Synchronization, Spirit Boost
Cheerleader: Cheerleader; Moment of Action; Go, 
Fight, Win!
Commander: The entire Class
