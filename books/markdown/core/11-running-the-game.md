Chapter 11:  
Running the Game
Getting Started
Fleshing out a world to play Pokémon Tabletop United can be trickier than it seems. It’s our philosophy that we 
should share our opinions and experiences with various types of options rather than prescribe a specific form of 
setting, so instead of telling you how it’s all gonna go down, we’ve readied a list of questions for you to think about 
when designing your setting.  Thinking about the answers to all of these questions should give you a very firm 
grasp about your setting, and clarifying these questions early with your players makes sure both you and your 
players have the same sort of expectations about the campaign.  So here we go!
Campaign Type?
What’s the emphasis of the campaign? Is it a standard 
“To be a Master” campaign where the party travels from 
town to town, collecting badges? Are you going to be 
fighting villainous teams? Is the campaign set in a non-
standard setting? Make sure to be very clear about this 
with your players! Don’t be afraid to do something a bit 
whacky. Here’s a small sample of some of the campaign 
premises for PTA and PTU we’ve witnessed over the 
past few years:
»»
Wild West Mons: a campaign following a group of 
travelers as they leave from Missouri and head out 
into the wild wild west.
»»
Turf Wars: set in a post-apocalyptic region, a 
group of Pokémon Trainers fights against gangs for 
dominance of a ruined city.
»»
Trainer Academy: Set in a high school for Trainers, 
this campaign detailed their adventures as they 
explored the school and battled a villainous team.
»»
Rocket Game: In this game the PCs WERE the 
villainous team! As members of Team Rocket, 
they had to work together to pull off increasingly 
dangerous and ridiculous crimes. 
»»
Pokétrian Odyssey: Inspired by the Etrian Odyssey 
games, a Guild of Trainers explores various 
dungeons and natural locations while battling 
powerful corrupted Pokémon and attempting to 
find the source of an ancient evil.
»»
Monster Hunters: Inspired by the Monster Hunter 
games, trainers would team up to take out giant 
monsters that became threats throughout a region.
As you can see, taking pretty much any other premise 
and adding Pokémon seems to be one approach. Don’t 
be afraid to try silly things, especially if you’re getting 
tired of “vanilla” games!

Be sure to check out the extra sourcebooks packaged with this book if you’re looking for inspiration to run non-
traditional Pokémon campaigns or if you want to add some exotic elements to spice up your campaign!
Is there a Pokémon League? 
If so, what’s the role of the Pokémon League in your 
setting? Is it at all related to the government, or 
completely separate? What are the duties of Gym 
Leaders in your setting? How are the League and 
championship structured? Are there “Elite Four” or 
similar groups? What’s their role? What about advanced 
content; Frontier Brains or similar?  If there ISN’T a 
Pokémon League, is there another activity that serves 
to give players milestones? Trainer Academy had class 
exams; Pokétrian gave milestones for defeating bosses. 
Whatever your setting, it’s good to have goals that can 
be met and rewarded appropriately periodically.
What’s the Technology Level? 
What are the implications of this? What items are and 
aren’t readily available? If modern technology isn’t 
available, are Poké Balls available somehow? Are only 
Apricorn Balls Available? Are no balls available? How 
are you going to handle TMs? What about Move Tutors 
and other NPC services?
Combat Emphasis?
Is “Trainer Combat” a big part of your campaign; or 
does it focus on Pokémon-only Combat? Both? How 
readily available are weapons? Will carrying a sword 
down the street quickly get law enforcement called, or 
does no one bat an eye at teenagers carrying guns and 
swords? 
Supernatural Phenomena?
Are Trainers with supernatural powers common? Are 
Legendary Pokémon merely rare species, or are they 
actual divinity? Will magic and powerful artifacts 
feature in the campaign, or are Pokémon the extent of 
the fantastical elements? You may make decisions about 
what Trainer Classes you’ll allow based on your answer 
to this question and the previous one.
Optional Rules?
Are you going to employ any optional rules in your 
campaign? Make sure to clarify this one with players 
from the start.
Constructing a Pokémon League
Most traditional Pokémon campaigns will feature a 
Pokémon League. So you might be asking yourself 
how you should put together your Pokémon League 
so it makes sense. Well, look no further! Here’s a basic 
outline for a League structure that’s suitable for most 
campaigns and gives you room to customize as well.
First of all, the Pokémon League usually governs all 
Pokémon Trainers in a region, including issuing Trainer 
IDs and tracking the registration of all caught Pokémon. 
The League often sponsors the Pokémon Professors 
who provide new Trainers with Starter Pokémon and 
set rules and regulations such as how many Pokémon a 
Trainer may carry with them at once. 
Leagues are different from Region to Region in a lot of 
ways, but one thing most of them have in common is 
the League is an extension of the local law enforcement 
as well as an entertainment venue.  Given the surplus 
of Teams and criminal organizations in the world 
of Pokémon, vigilantism is to some degree actively 
encouraged in certain settings. The League Officials 
both take part in this, and testing the region’s trainers 
better equips them to understand their own limits and 
handling these situations as well.  Based on how serious 
this side of matters are, some Leagues encourage Trainer 
Combat more than traditional sports based ones do. 
League Officials can be broken down into three groups: 
Gym Leaders, The Elite Four, and Frontier Brains. 
Gym Leaders are locally elected officials by each 
township or city to represent the spirit of the town, and 
help curb local crime.  While not always Type based, the 
geographical and cultural ties of a town often lead them 
to be. Gym Leaders are also able to enlist Gym Trainers 
to serve as both aids for testing wandering Trainers, 
and as Deputies to their local jurisdiction. While 
not necessarily under the command of an Elite Four 
member, they typically do answer to one for relations 
with nearby townships as well.
The Elite Four are individuals chosen by the League as 
a whole, and assigned sections of the Region to oversee 
on a broader scale than a Gym Leader does. These 


## Page 439

Running The Game
439
individuals are the cream of the crop and hold a little 
more political influence than Gym Leaders do. They 
are usually household names and recognized as both 
highly skilled Trainers, and great assets in a Region’s 
security. They don’t have an exact equivalent of a Gym 
Trainer, but can deputize Trainers to assist them in crisis 
situations.
Battle frontiers are areas in a region where Trainers 
who have conquered the League Challenge go for an 
additional challenge. They can be independently run 
and may be sponsored by large corporations or created 
by individual entrepreneurs. The Frontier Brains who 
run such areas often come from the more business side 
of things. They are chosen by powerful corporations 
in the Region to both assist in a manner similar to the 
Elite Four, and lobby on behalf of their corporations. 
While they are not as directly tied to the political side 
of things, money does talk and the corporations behind 
them do have their own interests.
A Trainer aspiring to gain one of these titles has some 
steep competition. Normally a Gym Trainer is going 
to be a native of their township, or a person of great 
influence who lives there. And while they are elected 
officials it’s not uncommon for a Gym Leader who has 
had a long tenure to endorse one of their Gym Trainers, 
which will almost shoehorn them into the position.  The 
best route for someone to become a Gym Leader is to 
gain notoriety in a local populace, or tutor with a Gym 
Leader and prove themselves that way.
Winning the title of Elite Four or Frontier Brain is a 
bit trickier. These individuals more often than not are 
former Champions of the League, heroes, or former 
Gym Leaders whose fame extended beyond their home 
towns.  Becoming a candidate for such a position not 
only requires raw skill, but knowing the right people, 
and doing something for the betterment of the whole 
Region and being recognized for it.

Running League Matches
Part of creating your Pokémon League is deciding how 
challenges are conducted. In a traditional format, Gym 
Battles and other League challenges are one on one 
affairs with set numbers of Pokémon on each side. 
Depending on the format of your campaign and how 
you tend to run sessions, this may or may not work. If 
you have plenty of time to schedule one on one meetings 
with players to play out League challenges, then by all 
means keep the traditional format. 
However, if you can only get together with your players 
as a whole group, then conducting one on one Gym 
Battles might be a bad idea. Battles can become lengthy 
in PTU, and that means most of your players will spend 
a lot of time doing a whole lot of nothing unless you 
can manage to run multiple battles at once (we don’t 
particularly recommend this!). 
What might be a better idea in this case is to make a 
group format for League challenges. Even simply 
allowing two on two Gym Battles can cut time spent 
waiting on others to battle in half. You may decide 
that Trainers create formalized teams or guilds in your 
setting to challenge the Pokémon League, having Gym 
Battles pit all of the PCs against the Gym Leader at once. 
Of course, you’ll want to hand-wave the usual limits 
on how many Pokémon turns a Gym Leader has each 
round for the purposes of such battles or at least give 
them Gym Trainers to battle at their side.
While in the video games you often must battle through 
many Gym Trainers to get to the Gym Leader, this 
typically isn’t a great idea in a tabletop campaign. It can 
easily become dull and time-consuming. Rather, you 
should work to make your Gym Battles unique and fun. 
Incorporating terrain elements and other environmental 
factors, creating puzzles to solve as part of the challenge, 
and using non-traditional victory conditions such as 
race battles, capture competitions, and fusion Contest-
Battles are all ways you can spice up your gyms. If you 
absolutely need to have the players do something before 
a Gym Battle, send them on interesting quests rather 
than running them through a gauntlet of Gym Trainers.
On a final note, don’t run a Gym Battle with too many 
Pokémon. Letting PCs use 3 each is more than enough. 
League Legality
For formal matches at Gym Battles and Tournaments, 
or even between trainers, walking straight up to your 
opponent’s Pokémon and personally giving them a swift 
kick is usually frowned upon quite severely. 
But many Features in PTU affect Pokémon, so how are 
you to know if these Features should be okay to use 
during such League functions? Well, the League Legality 
(leaguality?) of some Features may be hard to grasp, so 
here are some rules of thumb!
»»
If the Feature is a static or permanent change upon a 
Pokémon, such as Ace Trainer or Stat Trainer’s Stat 
boosting features, or an Athlete’s Coaching Feature, 
then they are definitely legal in all scenarios.
»»
All Features with the [Orders] Tag are League legal, 
unless specifically noted otherwise.
»»
If Feature is a Move, then it’s likely not league-legal. 
Leagual. Musicians could not use Screech or Sing 
on an opponent’s Pokémon, for example. You can’t 
even Leer with Intimidating Presence.
»»
Same goes for Abilities – using Intimidate on an 
opponent’s Pokémon is a no-no in a League match.
»»
If a Feature basically represents training or encour-
agement rather than direct intervention from the 
trainer (such as Ace Trainer, Cheerleader’s Gleeful 
Interference, or Athete’s Coaching), they should 
probably be okay to use.
»»
If the Feature comes from a supernatural source, 
such as Warper’s re-rolls, or Channeler’s … 
channeling, then these are not League Legal unless 
your league is very open to such things. Other 
features like Rune Master’s Words of Power, while 
supernaturally aided, represent training rather than 
direct intervention and thus can still be legal.
These are only guidelines, of course. In some campaigns, 
you may decide that Trainer Combat is allowed or even 
required for certain Gym Battles or Tournaments. If this 
is the case, you should probably discuss this with your 
players so they can build their characters with this quirk 
of the League in mind.

Alternatives to a Pokémon League
Maybe you want to run a Pokémon Tabletop United 
campaign in an unconventional setting, but your 
players are accustomed to the Gym Challenge format of 
the Pokémon franchise. A compromise is possible! It’s 
fairly easy and probably a good idea to apply the basic 
structure of a Pokémon League to other concepts. 
What are the basic elements of the Pokémon League 
structure? There is a series of challenges, usually each 
based around a theme, with incremental difficulty and 
a need to travel between challenges. Iconic personalities 
represent each challenge. Winning each challenge adds 
to a Trainer’s renown and credibility, and they often 
need to win a set number of them in order to qualify for 
a greater challenge or privilege. This is generic enough 
to allow a great deal of flexibility. 
Here are some examples to get you started: 
Pokémafia: A campaign based around criminal gangs 
may be based in a single city, which makes adapting a 
Gym Challenge format more difficult, but it certainly 
isn’t impossible. Separate rival gangs can be located in 
particular districts of the city and each given a theme, 
such as a Type, other means of choosing Pokémon, 
or a particular battling strategy. Obviously, each gang 
is headed by a Don who plays a similar role to a Gym 
Leader when confronted. As the PCs raid rival gang 
hideouts and gain control over the city, their renown 
will grow much like gaining Gym Badges. Eventually, 
they may qualify for a trial of sorts from their higher-
ups in their criminal hierarchy in order to take control 
over the operations in the city, similar to a Pokémon 
League Challenge. 
Alternatively, in a campaign in which the PCs play 
criminals in a world in which a Pokémon League exists, 
the iconic Gyms may still exist, but the manner in 
which the PCs challenge them is different. For example, 
assassinating Gym Leaders or subverting Gyms from 
within to take control of them for their criminal 
organization.
Trainer Academy: Rather than pursue Gym Challenges, 
the students at a Trainer Academy take regular exams 
which are designed to test their mastery of particular 
Types, Stats, or other battling concepts. Each exam is 
administered by a different Teacher, each with their 
own style like a Gym Leader would have. Of course, the 
consequences for failure are a bit more dire than simply 
failing to qualify for an annual tournament - fail too 
many exams, and you get kicked out of school! Passing 
exams with exemplary marks, however, earns you more 
privileges as a student, such as the right to explore 
special areas populated with rare wild Pokémon.
Poképirates: The sea can be a crowded place despite its 
vastness. Taking down other famous pirates, or perhaps 
the naval commanders and authorities of nearby 
countries, can help a fledgling pirate crew gain fame 
and treasure. The captain of a pirate ship or fleet takes 
the place of a Gym Leader.
Pokéfantasy: A series of large dungeons in the style of 
The Legend of Zelda can substitute for Gym Challenges. 
The opportunities for earning treasure and fame are 
obvious. When using this structure, you may choose 
to forgo using Trainers who play an analogous role 
to Gym Leaders. Instead, you may create special boss 
encounter Pokémon as the monsters at the end of each 
dungeon with unique powers and quirks. This is a great 
opportunity to introduce Type Shifted Pokémon, Giant 
Pokémon, and other variations. 
World War Pokémon: As the war advances, the PCs 
are sent to lead attacks on various enemy cities or to 
defend allied cities. It’s a good idea in this case to put 
the PCs in charge of attacks on major locations in a city, 
such as a valuable factory or a military headquarters. 
Enemy Generals and Commanders take the place of 
Gym Leaders. Rather than earn Gym Badges, the PCs 
gain promotions and earn additional privileges within 
the military hierarchy based on their rank.

Common Region Locales
Throughout the six generations of Pokémon games that 
have been released thus far, a number of similar locations 
have become recurring fixtures in the franchise. If 
you’re a long-time fan of Pokémon, you’re probably 
already familiar with most of these. However, if you’re 
new to Pokémon or simply want to make sure you cover 
all your bases with traditional Pokémon region features, 
this list may help you out!
Research Labs: With so much of the world focused on 
Pokémon, it’s no surprise that institutions for studying 
Pokémon are commonplace. These are also often 
where new Trainers begin their journey, receiving their 
first Pokémon and a Pokédex. Of course, each major 
Pokémon Professor in the franchise has their own lab. 
Safari Zones: While the most common way to acquire 
new Pokémon is to catch them out on routes or other 
places in the wilderness, many Pokémon regions have 
special parks called Safari Zones where rare species are 
raised in a controlled environment for Trainers to catch. 
These Safari Zones are usually organized into biomes 
containing varied species. Also common to Safari Zones 
is that battling the wild Pokémon is not allowed. Special 
Poké Balls are provided for capturing the Pokémon 
within or Trainers are expected to befriend the Pokémon 
they want. Aside from the Safari Zones in Kanto, Johto, 
and Hoenn, the Great Marsh in Sinnoh and the Friend 
Safaris in Kalos are also prominent examples.  
Pokémon Graveyards: Unfortunately, not everyone 
survives a Pokémon adventure. Many regions feature 
large memorials or graveyards where Trainers honor 
their fallen companions. Oftentimes, these are also 
locations where Ghost Type Pokémon tend to gather, 
and they may even be the only place where Ghost Types 
are found in abundance. Examples include the Pokémon 
Tower, Mt. Pyre, and the Celestial Tower. 
Ancient Ruins: The mysterious remnants of past 
civilizations also tend to play a large role in the Pokémon 
Universe. Many Legendary Pokémon have associations 
with such places or legends of the past, and they often 
make their home there. Ancient ruins can also be 
sources of mystical power and places to find unique 
artifacts or rare Pokémon. Getting to the ruins is often 
a challenge in itself, as they may be located in hard to 
reach places such as the ocean floor. The Ruins of Alph 
and the Abyssal Ruins are examples of ancient ruins. 
Shopping Megacenters: While shops are spread 
throughout a region, many regions have one particular 
city with a very large shopping complex that offers many 
goods that aren’t available anywhere else. While there’s 
nothing distinctively Pokémon about such places, they 
can provide something for players to look forward to 
after a long journey. Celadon City, Goldenrod City, and 
Lumiose City are all good examples. 
Entertainment Cities: Not every major city is 
known primarily for its Pokémon Gym. Many cities 
are primarily known for alternate activities such as 
Pokémon Contests or creating Pokémon movies. Game 
Corners where Trainers can gamble to earn prizes such 
as TMs or rare Pokémon also fall into this category. It’s 
a good idea to include cities of this nature in a region 
to give the players a break from the standard pattern of 
Gym Challenges. Virbank City and Hearthome City are 
well-known examples, being associated with Pokéstar 
Studios and the Super Contest Hall respectively. 
Shrines: While religion isn’t often directly addressed 
in the Pokémon franchise, there is often a culture of 
reverence for Legendary Pokémon that is represented 
by shrines dedicated to them. Sometimes these are also 
ancient ruins, but not always. Shrines provide a vessel 
for conveying the lore and mythology of a setting and 
are also handy places where a GM can create a trial for 
the PCs outside of Gym Challenges. The most famous 
example is probably the pair of Towers in Ecruteak City. 
Fossil Quarries: There are often special caves and 
other locations in a Pokémon region where the fossils 
of ancient Pokémon are found. Some of these locations 
may also contain other rare items such as Type Plates. 
It’s definitely a good idea to include these in a region, as 
they’re great ways to reward exploration. Mt. Moon and 
the Sinnoh Underground are both examples of places 
where fossils can be found. 
Villain Hideouts: Every criminal team needs a secret 
hideout! That’s just how it works; don’t question it. 
These make for fantastic ‘dungeons’ to send a group 
of PCs through, and a raid on a hideout is often the 
culmination of a long struggle against a criminal team. 
Team Rocket had hideouts under both the herb shop 
in Mahogany Town and the Game Corner in Celadon 
City. Team Magma, on the other hand, preferred to use 
a cave hidden in the side of Mt. Chimney.

Populating Your World With Pokémon
So you’ve created the basics of your campaign setting. You’ve drawn sweeping mountain ranges and scribbled 
winding rivers over your map. Labeled black dots mark your towns, and you’ve even penciled in a few thoughts 
about each of them in a notepad somewhere. 
What next? Well, you have to fill the world with Pokémon for your players to catch and battle, of course! 
When doing so, you’ll want to keep in mind two main goals, though which one you prioritize is up to you. The first 
principle is Fun Game Progression – making sure it’s enjoyable to journey through your world and the progression 
of Pokémon encountered from early in the campaign to later on is satisfying to the players.  The second is Sensible 
Ecosystems – that is, making sure the habitats and environments make up a believable world.
Fun Game Progression
 
There’s an obvious trend in Pokémon games regarding 
how the populations of the various routes, forests and 
caves change as you go through the game – the weaker, 
more vanilla Pokémon appear in earlier routes, and the 
more powerful and advanced Pokémon only show up 
after a good deal of adventuring. 
In general, this is a good macro-level principle to hold 
to when designing your world. It is good for guiding 
where you place Pokémon on a large scale and in the big 
picture. If the cave off to the side from your first route 
has Larvitars, Bagons and Gibles, there’s not much to 
look forward to when exploring more exotic locales.
 
One easy way to do this is to follow the examples of the 
video games. Many starting GMs, and those who have 
players with a particular hankering for nostalgia and 
playing through the regions they know and love, may 
choose to set their campaign in a canonical Pokémon 
region such as Kanto or Sinnoh. 
With this in mind, an easy starting point for designing 
habitats is to take the Pokémon encounter lists for each 
route or area for these regions and simply modify and 
add to them to suit your campaign. Of course, this may 
not always work. Players may find it unsatisfying or 
dull to face predictable encounters wherever they go. 
Or perhaps your campaign starts in Blackthorn City, 
and you don’t want your players nabbing Dratinis and 
Skarmories as their first captures. Either way, it can be 
a very good idea to deliberately change the possible 
encounters per area – and you can even tie this into 
a plot hook explaining why the environments have 
changed.


## Page 444

Running The Game
444
What if you have a custom region, as many GMs of the 
system will? Well, luckily for you, the Pokédex within 
each generation of Pokémon is still arranged roughly 
in order from common to rare, discounting the starter 
Pokémon. 
You can be pretty assured that picking mostly Pokémon 
from early on in any region’s Pokédex for the early game 
and dipping into the Pokémon near the end of the 
Pokédex more and more often as the game goes on will 
result in a satisfying distribution of Pokémon for your 
players. 
As a thematic measure, you may also wish to group 
together Pokémon from the same region. One forest 
early on has Hoothoots, Spinaraks, Hoppips, etc. A later 
cave is populated with Machokes, Gravelers, Onixes, etc. 
This works especially well if you have multiple defined 
regions in your campaign world or a set of islands or 
other clear delineations between areas. You do not have 
to follow this guideline, however, and it is probably 
easier and more interesting to mix and match Pokémon 
as you choose in any given area.
 What if your world is more open? There’s not always a 
clear path your players will take from one gym to the 
next as they travel. Well, all this means is you should 
keep the easily accessible parts of your campaign 
relatively equal in interesting Pokémon populations. 
This means the well-traveled routes between towns, or 
the lakes and forests that are in easy reach. Perhaps each 
has their population of relatively common Pokémon 
along with a smattering of more rare species. 
Save the pseudo-legendaries like Dratini and Beldum 
for the out of the way, difficult to reach places. In a 
cave system accessible only by diving underwater in 
a treacherous sea, for example. Or near the peaks in a 
mountain range filled with odd electromagnetic activity. 
This will ensure your players have a reason to seek out 
exotic locales while not being bored, no matter where 
they travel. Don’t be afraid to fudge things a little if your 
priority is ensuring satisfying game progression – you 
want to drop Scythers in a mid-game scenario but aren’t 
sure whether your players will go to one town or the 
other first? Save them for whichever path they come to 
later on, and populate the first path with common bugs.
Sensible Ecosystems
 
Following the games just isn’t enough for some GMs 
and players though. They want their world to make 
sense under scrutiny, for every chosen species to have 
its spot in its ecosystem. Or maybe the players just 
really like using Google in-character to figure out where 
Pokémon live, or they enjoy studying the interactions 
within ecosystems wherever they go. 
This is when you’ll want to give a sense of verisimilitude, 
making a setting and world feel real even if everyone 
knows it’s being tailored for a game. Where you can apply 
this idea best is when designing individual habitats and 
the Pokémon within them on a smaller scale.
 
Of course, making a sensible ecosystem applies on 
a large scale as well. You don’t put water types in the 
middle of a desert, and you don’t populate a dark cave 
with grass types who need sunlight to survive. But when 
you get to individual habitats is where it can really help 
to think about what makes sense in an ecosystem and 
how they function.
 
First, think about the energy pyramid in an ecosystem. 
No, you don’t have to get into any advanced biology to 
do this. Just think generally about food sources and food 
chains here. Keep in mind that producers, that is, plant-
life (or photosynthetic grass Pokémon perhaps!) are the 
most populous denizens of an environment, and the 
higher up you go on the food chain, the rarer a species 
becomes. The Sewaddles which feed off of leaves in the 
forest will be much more numerous than the Pidgeys 
eating them which are in turn less common than higher 
level predators such as Sevipers. This, luckily, works out 
pretty well when it comes to meshing with satisfying 
game progression, since most of the rare Pokémon tend 
to be powerful predators.
Secondly, you will also want to consider niches and 
competition in an ecosystem, though this is one level 
of detail that you may wish to ignore to save headaches 
and maximize fun. However, here is an example. In 
a dark forest, a Pokémon such as Murkrow may be a 
much more efficient predator due to its ability to blend 


## Page 445

Running The Game
445
in with its surroundings, compared to Pokémon in the 
Spearow line. If both exist in one ecosystem, it’s likely the 
Murkrow will out-compete the Spearows and the latter 
will go extinct. The opposite may be true in the case of a 
more open plains where the Spearows’ coloration helps 
them blend into the tall grass when they aren’t flying. 
Of course, another possible result of this is, of course, 
adaptation. Species in a particular area may adopt traits 
that help them compete against and survive against 
otherwise better prepared species.
Cast’s Note: Essentially what I’m saying here is – Type-
shifts, different Ability options, changed Move 
lists, different Skill or Capability allocations. 
There’s a lot you can do here to represent these 
adaptations, though you should use this option sparingly. 
The Spearow population in the aforementioned example 
may have higher Stealth ranks, a dark coloration, or 
Moves that let them compete with Murkrow better.
Finally, many Pokémon have very weird diets and 
other living requirements. Magnemites, Voltorbs, and 
the like are probably mostly found in industrial areas, 
where there’s enough electrical machinery from human 
civilization to sustain their populations. And if you’re 
running a historical campaign set before the invention 
of electric-powered technology, don’t be afraid to say 
some species simply don’t exist if they wouldn’t make 
sense. Looking at you, Porygon and Rotom.
 
You’ll want to keep these needs and preferences in 
mind across all sorts of different species. Ghosts, while 
they do not strictly require run-down habitats, may be 
much more comfortable living in abandoned homes 
and similar places rather than shiny, clean, urban 
environments. Perhaps they feed off the emotional 
energy of sites of tragedy. Dragons, even if they have 
easy to meet biological requirements, may have been 
hunted to near extinction in the past due to their value. 
As such, you may only find them nowadays in out of the 
way caves and mountains.
 
It may simply be that you need to introduce quirky 
locations just to facilitate the existence of certain 
Pokémon species, such as the Ruins of Alph for Unown. 
You may add an ancient temple floating above a desert 
to your world to hold Yamask and Sigilyph populations, 
or you decide ghosts in general are rare enough that 
you need to introduce a Pokémon Tower or Mt. Pyre 
counterpart to specially house them. A Safari Zone 
where rare Pokémon species are bred for trainers to 
capture is another easy way to solve the problem of 
exotic species for which you can’t find a proper home.
 
No one can tell you the one right way to handle how 
you populate your Pokémon world, but if you keep in 
mind these two goals and maintain balance with what 
your players want and expect, you’ll come out of the 
worldbuilding process with a set of ecosystems that will 
keep everyone happy.

This has been alluded to before, but another crucial 
aspect of your campaign that you will need to decide is 
how animalistic or human-like your Pokémon act.
Do you want to replicate the feeling of the anime where 
Pokémon generally understand human languages, know 
what a Poké Ball is and even how to operate it or trick 
it, and act with pretty much the personality of a person 
aside from their quirk of repeating their names? Can 
Pokémon form small gangs like the Squirtle Squad with 
human-like characteristics or even learn to talk like 
Meowth? Do Pokémon generally want to be captured 
and desire a formidable Trainer to call their partner?
Or do you prefer to portray Pokémon as feral animals 
which need to be tamed and may initially react to Poké 
Balls and capture with extreme fear and confusion? Is 
Pokémon training a necessity for survival in a dangerous 
world rather than a popular sport and pastime? 
It’s important to discuss your intentions on this subject 
with your players so there’s no confusion once the game 
starts. You wouldn’t want to create a harsh world of feral 
Pokémon and be met with PCs who immediately try to 
pet and talk to the local wildlife, nor would you want 
to create a lighthearted Pokémon setting to find that a 
player has made a character who treats all Pokémon as 
inherently dangerous and potential threats to his life. 
On a mechanical level, you’ll need to decide whether or 
not Pokémon need social and knowledge skills added to 
their normal stats. Chapter 5: Pokémon provides some 
guidelines for creating Skillsets for Pokémon (page 201). 
Regardless of your answer here, you should consider 
Pokémon hierarchies and social organization. Very 
few Pokémon live in complete isolation. Bug Types 
have hive structures, many feline and canine Pokémon 
have packs, Flying Types have flocks, and Water Types 
may live in large schools of fish. These should factor 
into encounters you create, as some sort of leader will 
usually be present in a group of Pokémon.
Further, understand that ‘intelligence’ is itself a vague 
term that encompasses plenty of different meanings. 
Pokemon are unlikely to be well-read or book smart the 
same way a human might be, though some Psychic types 
like Alakazam may take an interest in reading. However, 
a Pokemon like Bellosom might tell time by the position 
of the sun and read plant growth patterns to determine 
soil quality, but not understand how telephones work.
When deciding how intelligent Pokémon are, both in 
general, and in relation to each other, it’s most important 
to think about types of intelligence rather than trying 
to make intelligence into a single sliding scale. As a 
baseline, however, Pokémon should be smart enough 
to understand basic commands; otherwise Pokémon 
battling wouldn’t get very far. 
Take, for example, memory. Some Pokémon may have a 
hard time being taught complex tasks, such as Combee, 
but their memory is excellent and perhaps rivals that of 
humans when it comes to creating a cognitive map and 
memorizing the layout of a field and where good spots 
for flowers and other valuables are. 
Tool use and social intelligence are other categories to 
consider. We often associate tool use and the ability to 
adapt to human language and communication, such as 
sign language, as signs of intelligence in animals, but 
some Pokémon species may have highly developed 
social intelligence and social hierarchies but simply 
be incompatible with human attempts at complex 
communication. Birds are one place where the common 
wisdom says they aren’t particularly intelligent, but 
many birds are able to make use of tools and can learn 
over time how to more efficiently take advantage of 
human creations. 
In general, assume that a Pokemon is at least as 
intelligent as it needs to be to survive in its natural 
habitat. Predator species can tell the difference between 
Rattata and Nidoran, to avoid getting poisoned by the 
latter. Canine Pokemon employ pack tactics when 
hunting, feline Pokemon know how to ambush and 
hide, bird Pokemon can read air currents, and so on. A 
Caterpie knows how to eat, how to spin silk, and how to 
escape predators – anything beyond that is likely to be 
beyond them unless you’re treating Pokémon as a whole 
as particularly human-like. 
Once a Pokemon is captured, it’s almost certainly going 
to get smarter. In the real world, there’s a difference 
between a smart dog and a smart service dog, and 
that sort of difference can carry over into Pokemon. 
Exposure to novel situations and a close bond with a 
trainer can bring out more apparent intelligence from

an individual Pokemon as that Pokemon learns. Even 
taking an animalistic interpretation of Pokémon into 
account, the majority of Pokemon can reach a childlike 
level of intelligence after working with a Trainer, and 
that’s a comfortable place to stop. After being caught, 
that Caterpie may understand what Poké Balls are for, 
but not how they work or how to use them.
 
Some GMs may decide that special exceptions exist for 
Pokemon with the Telepath, Aura Reader, or Aura Pulse 
capabilities. These Pokemon are often comparable to 
humans in how much they understand when it comes to 
communication, as being able to read thoughts removes 
any language barrier in place. However, low stage 
Pokemon may still be limited by juvenile perspectives or 
a lack of education. Like humans, even these relatively 
smart Pokemon need experiences and instruction to 
show off true intelligence.
 
For most campaigns, an easy guideline to keep in mind is 
that most Pokemon can be smart, but they shouldn’t be 
so smart that they make the Trainer character obsolete. 
It’s perfectly acceptable to have a Pokemon realize that 
fire and smoke are bad and to drag an unconscious 
trainer out of their house before it burns down. It’s less 
acceptable to have the same Pokemon realize there’s a 
fire extinguisher under the sink and to put out the flames 
before calling 911 themselves. Coco the Primeape may 
know sign language, but she doesn’t know how to hold 
down a job. Otherwise, you may run into issues with 
players feeling uncomfortable with catching Pokémon 
that are so human-like or having trouble keeping track 
of so many NPCs with complex personalities. That isn’t 
to say you can’t run a campaign with more human-
like Pokémon, but you should be aware of the issues 
and level of work before doing so. Very human-like 
Pokémon, such as Meowth in the anime, can be a fun 
and refreshing addition to a campaign.
On a related note, another source of potential awkward-
ness is Water-Type Pokémon in general. In Pokémon 
media, aquatic Pokémon are often seen functioning just 
fine out of water, either by flopping about or floating. 
It’s up to you whether to follow this example or subvert 
it by restricting fish to the water. We don’t take a stance 
in the system, but you should make sure your players 
know yours!

Pokémon Habitat List
This list is simply a compilation of the information in the Pokédex PDF on which Pokémon live in which habitats. 
If you’re stumped on what species to populate a route or section of your world with, this makes for a handy 
reference. Feel free to deviate from this list, however, if you have other ideas for where Pokémon might make their 
homes in your setting. For example, you might have a mountain-dwelling version of Spinark and Ariados.

Handling Player Pokémon Knowledge
Chances are, some or all of your players will practically 
be walking Pokémon encyclopedias, especially if they 
spend a lot of time with competitive battling in the 
video games. Should you be worried about your players 
bringing this knowledge into your Pokémon Tabletop 
United campaigns? 
In most cases, we think the answer is not to worry about 
it too much. There may be times you specifically want 
to tell the players that a particular Pokémon species is 
one they’ve never encountered before, such as when you 
decide a Pokémon hasn’t been discovered yet in your 
region, but otherwise it’s safe to allow players to use 
most of their Pokémon knowledge. 
Trainers would typically know quite a lot when it comes 
to basic Pokémon knowledge, so long as they have at 
least Untrained Pokémon Education. What Types a 
Pokémon has, how the Types interact, and even basic 
qualitative knowledge about how a particular species 
tends to battle is all assumed to be common sense or part 
of basic education in the Pokémon world. Remember 
that society in the Pokémon world revolves around 
Pokémon to a large degree, which means it’s difficult to 
function without knowing these basics. 
If someone is playing a character with Pathetic Pokémon 
Education, or you have species that are undiscovered in 
your campaign world, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask 
your players to roleplay appropriately. Any issues about 
metagaming should resolved the same way; talk to your 
group and figure out what a reasonable standard is for 
how much a Trainer might know about a given  random 
Pokémon when encountered in the field.
Remember that the Pokémon franchise itself is based 
around strategic battling that requires knowledge about 
Pokémon to enjoy, and a lot of players seek out Pokémon 
Tabletop United to find fresh new avenues to explore 
that aspect of the franchise, even as they’re enjoying the 
roleplaying experience. Forcing them to pretend away 
all of their Pokémon knowledge can seriously harm 
their enjoyment of the campaign. 
This isn’t to say that players will be able to know 
everything about Pokémon without making any rolls 
– Pokémon Education is still useful for learning about 
behavioral patterns of Pokémon or their biological 
needs. Even if everyone at the table recognizes a 
Weavile and can tell you it’s an Ice/Dark Type with high 
Speed and Attack, they wouldn’t necessarily know how 
to describe their social behavior or hunting habits. A 
Pokédex or high Pokémon Education Skill would also 
be necessary to know very specific information about 
what Moves a Pokémon can learn or what Abilities it 
gains as it grows. 
Your play group may also have players who aren’t as 
experienced with the Pokémon franchise. This is fine as 
well, and you should encourage your other players to 
help them out when it comes to knowledge that should 
be common sense for their characters. 
Finally, you always have the option as a GM to throw 
curveballs at your players in the form of Shiny Pokémon, 
Type Shifted Pokémon, or even homebrew Pokémon of 
your own creation.

Campaign Structure
Even for an experienced GM, Pokémon Tabletop 
United presents a set of unique challenges. As in most 
tabletop RPGs, you tend to hit a stride after a certain 
point where you can either dedicate most of your time 
and preparation to a central plot, focus upon character-
centric plot arcs, or create a “sandbox” of highly varied 
activities for the players to get into. 
However, while in most RPGs you quickly grow out of 
the simple and repetitive quests used to introduce players 
into the world or the system, most Pokémon tabletop 
campaigns will retain a set of those basic activities 
throughout: catching Pokémon and challenging Gym 
Leaders. It can be a challenge to maintain an interesting 
variety in these activities as well as keeping the pacing 
of a campaign on the right track. 
A good guideline is to roughly split the campaign into 
two different phases: One in which there’s relative calm 
and the players are able to easily pursue Pokémon Gyms 
and other personal interests without interference, and 
one in which your larger plot intercedes and demands 
that action be taken on it. 
Early on in a campaign, you want to lean harder on the 
former phase, giving players plenty of time to explore 
on their own terms and develop their Pokémon teams. 
Later on, as players have formed solid teams and are 
reluctant to take on new members, you can phase out 
the idea of throwing in plentiful random encounters. 
As you introduce more of your central plot elements 
or character-centric plots, weave them in with the 
obligatory standard Trainer activities. A Gym Leader 
goes on hiatus until a threat to the town is dealt with. 
Perhaps they’re on call to deal with a criminal Team 
and have brought their Gym Trainers along to help 
too. Players stumble upon clues to the overall plot as 
they’re out catching Pokémon. Maybe they literally fall 
into some ancient ruins as they battle wild Pokémon 
over shaky ground, or maybe they might encounter an 
important NPC while exploring an uncharted route. 
Do this sort of weaving in the other direction as 
well. Perhaps the players need an expert on ancient 
civilizations to analyze an artifact they found, and their 
research leads them to an expert who happens to be a 
Gym Leader. The Gym Leader may even require the PCs 
to take on their challenge if they think they’re getting 
into too dangerous a situation and need to be tested to 
see if they’re truly ready yet. A search for a wanted Team 
Rocket member could lead the PCs to find a hideout 
holding abused Pokémon, some of which the PCs may 
adopt. This adds to their teams, furthers the plot at the 
same time, and gives them a personal reason to pursue 
the villains. 
Done well, this will ensure one phase of the campaign 
flows neatly into the next, always letting the players see 
when they’ll have an opportunity to pursue their own 
interests as well as explore the plot you’ve laid out for 
them. They shouldn’t ever feel like pursuing one has to 
come at the cost of the other. 
When it comes to concluding a campaign, there are 
two main ways you can approach this when running a 
traditional League-based game. You can either conclude 
the overall plot and tie up character arcs before using the 
Pokémon League tournament as an epilogue of sorts to 
the campaign, or you can leave a calm before the storm 
in the sessions leading up to the League tournament, 
then set in motion the climactic events of the plot after 
the Pokémon League concludes or even right as post-
League celebrations are beginning. 
Either way, this ensures the League itself, if it is an 
important event for your game, is relatively isolated 
from other matters which might distract your players 
from it or keep them from fully enjoying it. 
Rules are meant to be broken, of course, and you can 
certainly use disruption of the Pokémon League as a 
major plot point in and of itself. The suggestions laid 
out here are just provide a solid foundation to a very 
traditional game, and you’ll likely want to deviate from 
this structure as you play and GM more campaigns of 
Pokémon Tabletop United. 
This is just the start of where you can go with the system. 
In a campaign without a focus on a Pokémon League or 
Contest Circuit or equivalent event, another well tested 
structure is to make the PCs part of an organization 
such as law enforcement, students at a Pokémon Trainer 
academy, or an exploration team and run mission-based 
sessions. Not only is this easy to organize, but it makes 
keeping the PCs well paid easy too!

Creating Compelling Sessions
Now you have an idea of how to handle the overall 
structure of a campaign, but you still have to keep each 
individual gaming session engaging for your players. 
Here are some easy guidelines to help with that.
1. Sessions should promote interactivity. 
This has multiple layers of meaning. First of all, it means 
your session should give your players plenty of room 
to make choices and influence the outcome of events. 
They shouldn’t feel like they’re simply sitting through a 
narrated series of events or reading a book. 
Second of all, the events in your session should promote 
interaction between the PCs. Tie together one character’s 
interests with another’s. Make tasks require Skills held 
by different PCs or the use of different Pokémon on 
their teams, and encourage them to talk through those 
tasks and turn them into RP opportunities. 
2. Sessions should contain meaningful content.
More than simply containing interactive choices, those 
choices should be meaningful and interesting. Combat 
is by its very nature interactive, but fighting bland 
swarms of wild Pokémon won’t give players a sense that 
they can make changes that matter in your world. 
This doesn’t necessarily require you to make world-
spanning plots either. The simplest way to create 
meaningful choices for the PCs is to have them implicate 
personal goals and bring in character backgrounds. Of 
course, not every single session needs to be filled with 
this sort of content; it’s a good idea to have occasional 
fluffier sessions to give players a break. 
3. Sessions should provide self-contained satisfaction 
while also contributing to a larger whole. 
Much like an episode of a good TV show, each segment 
of a campaign should be satisfying in and of itself while 
also adding to an overall plot. It’s no good to drop a 
bunch of clues and hints about later plot developments 
but leave players feeling like they didn’t actually do 
much or accomplish anything in the session, and it’s 
no better to create magnificently crafted sessions after 
sessions if all of them are completely episodic and 
unrelated to each other, with no overarching stories or 
character arcs.
This is another rule that can be bent a little, in the sense 
that it’s okay to have occasional standalone sessions that 
aren’t tied to anything else in particular but are a lot of 
fun in themselves. Usually, these are sillier off the wall 
sessions such as bug catching competitions, whacky 
Contests, and other fun minigame activities. 
Pre-Campaign Preparations
Let’s start with some prep work you should do at the 
beginning of a campaign, before you even run the first 
session. Doing this very soon after the first session is 
okay as well, but it can be time-consuming and cut into 
your time to prepare your next few sessions. 
Create a small dossier on each PC. Don’t make it too 
long; you have to do about 4 or 5 of these in a standard 
campaign, after all. What should you include in this 
dossier? Talk to your players about how they want 
their PCs to develop. Which parts of their character 
backgrounds are most important to them? What are 
their characters’ main skills and interests? Do they have 
developed goals from the outset, or will they pick those 
up as the game goes on? Do your players have any out-
of-character desires for the game? For example, if they’d 
like to have the party visit a particular type of locale 
sometime or if they want their character to get into 
trouble and shenanigans often. If you’re taking down 
wishlists, put them in the dossier as well. 
These will be your reference documents for what kind 
of material to include in sessions when you’re stumped 
for ideas. Be especially careful at this stage to make sure 
you have ideas in mind for how to hook in PCs who 
have more mundane or obscure Skill choices. 
Break In Case of PC Choices
It’s inevitable. You will have your plans dashed by the 
players making decisions you didn’t realize were even in 
the realm of possibility for them. Plan for a few sessions 
in a new city, and the PCs will instead latch onto the 
merchant NPC passing through town who makes an 
off-handed remark about heading into the desert, and 
the next thing you know they’ve declared themselves his 
bodyguards and are dead set on outfitting themselves in 
archeology gear and searching for ancient Unown ruins 
and fossils for the next couple of sessions.

Don’t fret. This is a trial by fire that all GMs go through, 
and you’ll emerge from it as a stronger and wiser GM. 
Later in this chapter, you’ll see guides on quickly building 
NPCs and fast Pokémon statting for encounters, which 
can help you improvise in these situations. 
However, the best way to prepare for this eventuality is 
to create a toolkit of modular adventures that can be 
sprinkled through new locations as you need them. It 
takes a lot of initial time investment to make these, but 
when you’re done, you can shove ‘em in a box, slap a 
“Break In Case of PC Choices” label on the top, and sit 
them on your desk feeling much less stressed out about 
these potential situations. 
This works hand-in-hand with the dossiers you’ve 
created on your PCs before the start of the campaign. 
Here are some examples of how to put this into practice:
Campaign Prep Examples
First, let’s establish two characters for a hypothetical 
GM to create dossiers and run sessions for. 
Marty is a Researcher focusing on botany and herbs. He 
mainly specializes in Survival and General Education, 
with a bit of dabbling in other Education Skills such 
as Technology. He also has a magnetic personality and 
the Charm Skill to match. Marty’s player hasn’t really 
thought much yet about his in-character goals, but he 
knows that he wants to capture Pokémon like Sneasel 
and Swinub and puts them on a wishlist for his GM. 
Abigail is a quiet and introspective Telepath. Despite her 
mind reading abilities, she isn’t great with people and is 
lacking in Skills such as Charm and Guile. However, she 
has great Body Skills such as Acrobatics and Athletics, 
along with the Focus needed for her telepathic powers. 
Her major in-character motivation is to uncover the 
secret behind a mysterious bombing at a Silph Co. 
office building that took her parents’ lives, but out-of-
character, Abigail’s player wants the adventure to lead to 
ancient ruins somewhere. 
The GM begins thinking on a number of scenarios he 
can put in his back pocket for sessions where he’s caught 
off guard and needs content. 
First, he thinks about his cities. He’s left the specific 
institutions and attractions of each city deliberately 
vague aside from a few major defining characteristic of 
each city, leaving him free to shuffle plot points around.
He comes up with a group of former Silph employee 
NPCs who knew Abigail’s parents and might be able to 
help her discover who was behind the bombing. They 
were nearly caught in the explosion as well though, 
and they’re reluctant to talk about what happened. The 
GM figures he can use this to have either Abigail make 
use of her Telepathy, or have Marty assist her with his 
charming personality. 
Obviously, with an ominous terrorist attack in one of 
his PCs’ backstories, the GM is going to need to work 
in some sort of criminal Team angle into his campaign, 
so he thinks of ways he can get Marty’s player invested 
in this sort of plotline as well. He constructs a scenario 
about a few high profile murders carried out by Team 
Verdance, a group of ecological terrorists, using poisons 
harvested from various Grass Type Pokémon such as 
Vileplume, Parasect, and Amoonguss – perfect for 
Marty’s botany specialty. For the victims, he creates 
NPCs who are close to acquaintances or friends of both 
Marty and Abigail, to give them a way into the scenario 
and a reason to investigate.
Even with these two scenarios on hand, the GM feels 
like he’d be more comfortable if he had a few more 
session ideas he could throw at his players if they make 
their way to a town where he has little prepared. 
Knowing that Marty will find himself poking around 
herb and berry shops often, he maps out an underground 
Team Verdance hideout underneath an herb shop. He’s 
not sure exactly how the PCs will stumble upon it, but 
he’s confident that if he has the base prepared, he can 
improvise a way to rope the PCs into exploring it if he 
hits a slow session. 
Then, realizing that he’s been leaning pretty heavily on 
the criminal team aspect of things, he decides to prepare 
something lighter and comes up with a celebratory 
festival he can drop into a town the PCs are visiting. 
Among the attractions will be Pokémon Contests, a 
small amateurs’ battling tournament, and other small 
minigames – with prizes such as rare herbs and berries, 
relics from ancient civilizations, and other items he 
knows the players will have an interest in. 
Done with his “just in case” session ideas for the cities, 
the GM turns to filling the wilds with adventure seeds, 


## Page 457

Running The Game
457
which is a bit trickier due to the variance in terrains 
and environments the players will encounter. He needs 
something that’s terrain-agnostic to throw at his PCs. 
The GM isn’t too worried about preparing encounters 
for capturing Pokémon – he’s done some rough planning 
for what kinds of species go where, and he’s sure he can 
stat them up quickly as need be. However, he does need 
some events on the road that the PCs can follow up on 
as adventure seeds. 
After some writing, he comes up with a few scenarios 
that fit multiple different terrains – collapsed bridges 
that have stopped other traveling Trainers, Pokémon 
transport vehicles that have crashed and lead to the 
Pokémon inside escaping, Pokémon driven feral by 
questionable scientific experiments, etc. He ties some 
of the NPCs involved in these scenarios to the Team 
Verdance plotline, some of them to Marty’s past and to 
the research lab he was a part of, and some to various 
other ideas the GM has had for potential plots, such as 
a small silly cult worshipping the Unown and a group of 
researchers searching for Legendary Pokémon. 
However, after comparing his notes for his cities and 
for the wilderness, he concludes that his city-centric 
adventures are a lot more cohesive and focused due to 
their ties to the Team Verdance plotline. He decides to 
create something equivalent for the wilds and realizes 
he’s yet to hit on either Abigail’s player’s desire to find 
ancient ruins and Marty’s player’s wishlist much.
Eventually, he comes up with the idea that an ancient 
civilization once created a floating city similar to the 
Sword of the Vale in the Pokémon Black and White 
movies. However, during a terrible war, the city was 
destroyed and its parts scattered all over the region. 
Some of these parts are fragments of wondrous and 
powerful ancient artifacts, making them valuable and 
sought after prizes. 
To rope the PCs into this hunt, the GM decides he’ll drop 
some hints about Silph Co. researching these artifacts 
shortly before the bombing that killed Abigail’s parents, 
and for Marty, he has one of the young researcher’s 
mentors who taught him about botany approach him 
with his discovery of a mysterious plant that was icy 
cold and exuded a freezing aura around it – found in the 
ruins of one particularly intact part of the ancient city. 
Eventually, Abigail and Marty should find enough hints 
through the hunt for artifacts to lead them to a set of 
ruins high up in the snowy mountains – perfect for 
Marty to catch a Sneasel or Swinub and also a way to 
satisfy Abigail’s player’s curiosity about ancient ruins. 
Satisfied with his emergency box of session ideas, the 
GM is confident going into the start of his campaign. 
Unfortunately, however, not everything goes perfectly 
as planned. It turns out the way he wrote the role of the 
ex-Silph NPCs, it was too easy for Abigail to simply read 
their minds and get whatever information she needed, 
and Marty’s player consistently felt left out of sessions 
involving those NPCs. 
Luckily, our GM is familiar with this issue, that it is much 
easier to give out plot hooks to those with supernatural 
powers and thus necessary to think carefully about 
making sure everyone is equally involved, whether they 
are normal humans or gifted with supernatural talents. 
It’s an easy change for him – he has the NPCs become 
a bit more willing to give out information, but they are 
difficult to convince to come along to help investigate 
old shut down Silph labs and other areas of interest 
without Marty’s smooth talking. Once in those areas, 
Abigail’s athleticism helps everyone stay safe and access 
hard to reach areas while Marty continues to contribute 
with his knowledge of technology. 
In the end, the players get to experience a wonderful 
campaign, and the GM has fun as well with relatively 
worry-free GMing due to the preparation they did 
before the campaign began.

Basic GMing Tasks
No matter what kind of campaign you’re running, there 
are some tasks that are universal to GMing. Adjudicat-
ing challenges, overseeing character creation, handing 
out Experience Points, all that good stuff. What about 
creating combat encounters? you might ask. That will 
get its own section in this chapter, don’t you worry. For 
now, let’s start from the top.
Character Creation And You
The very first thing you need to present to your players 
after describing the premise and assumptions of your 
campaign is a set of guidelines for building their 
characters. 
For a great many campaigns, what we outlined in the 
Character Creation chapter is appropriate: Level 1 
Trainers with a single Level 5 or 10 Pokémon and $5000 
to spend on items or to keep as cash. 
However, you might decide that your PCs need to 
be more experienced from the start. Perhaps they’re 
seasoned Trainers brought together in a special task 
force by the Pokémon League, or maybe they’re just 
mildly experienced Gym Trainers out to find their own 
adventure. 
Either way, you would simply raise the starting Level for 
characters in the campaign and allow them to choose 
more and higher leveled Pokémon to start. You may also 
decide to increment their starting money, increasing it 
anywhere from $500 to $750 per additional starting 
Level. Depending on what level your PCs start at, you 
may wish to limit what items they can purchase with 
their starting cash. For instance, you don’t want Level 1 
Trainers buying Hyper Beam TMs. 
It’s recommended that you don’t have your players start 
with more than perhaps three starter Pokémon at the 
maximum (and that’s for an experienced Trainer for a 
game that begins above Trainer Level 1) unless you’re 
having someone join in an ongoing campaign midway 
where the rest of the players already have established 
teams. A lot of the fun of Pokémon is discovering 
Pokémon and forming your team over time, and starting 
with too many Pokémon can undercut this experience. 
If players worry about getting all the Pokémon they 
want, you may ask them to create a wishlist. Don’t follow 
it religiously, but it can help you satisfy your players.
Starter Pokémon 
In general, you may want players to select Pokémon 
with three evolutionary stages for their starters so their 
first Pokémon has room to grow with their Trainer over 
time. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, and you may allow 
two stage evolutions or even weak single stage Pokémon. 
Using the classification of Underdog Pokémon is 
another way of making starter selection easier. 
But even within this category, you’ll want to keep 
some guidelines in mind.  You may choose to limit 
“Pseudo-Legendary” Pokémon such as Dratini, Bagon, 
Gible, and Larvitar. When players begin with such rare 
Pokémon, it makes it difficult to give them somewhere 
more exciting to go. 
On a more practical and mechanical level, some 
Pokémon that are available in the end-game of the 
video games tend to learn much more powerful Moves 
at lower levels than Pokémon available earlier on do. For 
instance, Larvitar learns Rock Slide at Level 19, which is 
a rather low Level for such a strong Move. 
You should be careful when looking at the Ability 
choices Pokémon have as well. Abilities which give a 
boost to Damage Bases are very potent in the beginning 
stages of the game. Technician and Iron Fist are two 
examples of Abilities that can give Pokémon a huge 
early game boost. We aren’t suggesting you ban these 
Abilities outright, but you should watch carefully as 
your players select starters to ensure no one is going to 
be marginalized. 
Generally, it’s a good idea to allow players to select the 
Ability, Gender, and Nature of their starter to avoid the 
RNG leaving them with a poor Pokémon for what’s 
supposed to be one of their most important companions.
Finally, it’s not a bad idea to give starter Pokémon an 
Inheritance List. For Pokémon without Egg Moves, you 
may even pick from Tutor or TM Moves for this list 
instead. Generally, the further you get into a campaign, 
the more interesting and unique Pokémon you’ll hand 
out to your players, whether it be shiny Pokémon, well-
bred specimens, or simply rare catches. It can be easy 
for starters to be left behind mechanically, but a set of 
2-3 Inheritance Moves can help offset this.

Sample Starter Pokémon List
Following the guidelines laid out on the previous page, here are a number of Pokémon that make for good starters, 
sorted by the canonical Regional starters and then by Type. The Types chosen for this are largely those which are 
less “mundane” and more likely to have fantastical elemental or supernatural powers. Many Normal, Bug, and 
Flying Types are not only very common but less interesting than a Fire or Electric Type. 
Keep in mind that even within this list some Pokémon may be slightly more useful than others in early levels, 
particularly because some Pokémon that make for great starters are reliant on Struggle Attacks for the first few 
levels. Rock, Steel, and Ghost Type starter Pokémon may also end up very powerful if most enemies have mainly 
Normal Type attacks early on, so GMs should be very careful about allowing these Types for starters, even if they 
are listed below. If early opponents are likely to have varied Typed attacks, then this is much less of an issue.

This isn’t meant to be a comprehensive list by any means! Your players will likely have ideas for starters outside 
of this list, even within the Types represented, and that’s perfectly okay. Just consider them on a case by case basis 
using the guidelines we’ve laid out already. 
There is also some repetition in this list. For the most part, we try to populate it with three-stage Pokémon, but it 
isn’t always possible to find multiple three-stage families in a given Type that are appropriate as Starters.

Rewards and Experience
Another important part of GMing is handing out 
Experience so your PCs can grow and advance as they 
explore the world.
Calculating Pokémon Experience
Calculating Experience after an encounter is easy.
»»
First off, total the Level of the enemy combatants 
which were defeated. For encounters where Trainers 
were directly involved in the combat, treat their 
Level as doubled for the sake of this calculation. For 
example, if your players fought a Level 10 Trainer 
with a level 20 Pokémon, Base Experience Value for 
this encounter is 40.
»»
Second, consider the significance of the encounter. 
This will decide a value to multiply the Base 
Experience Value. See below for details on picking a 
significance multiplier.
»»
Third, divide the Experience by the number of 
players gaining Experience. Divide by the number 
of Players – not the number of Pokémon. If a 
Trainer used multiple Pokémon, he will have to split 
his experience among the Pokémon he used. The 
resulting number is how much experience is gained 
by each Trainer!
Significance Multiplier
The Significance Multiplier should range from x1 to 
about x5, and there’s many things to consider when 
picking this value.
First, consider narrative significance. This will inform 
your “base” significance multiplier.
An encounter against wild Pidgeys probably doesn’t have 
any significance; an encounter against a rival trainer has 
more; and an encounter for the championship title has 
lots!
»»
Insignificant encounters should trend towards the 
bottom of the spectrum at x1 to x1.5.
»»
“Average” everyday encounters should be about x2 
or x3.
»»
More significant encounters may range anywhere 
from x4 to x5 depending on their significance; a 
match against an average gym leader might merit 
as high as x4. A decisive battle against a Rival or in 
the top tiers of a tournament might be worth x5 or 
even higher!
Next, consider the challenge and threat being posed. 
Even if a wild Pokémon doesn’t have much narrative 
significance, a very strong wild Pokémon may be 
able to inflict serious damage to trainers and their 
Pokémon. Conversely, a fight against an unskilled 
Gym Leader might hardly be a challenge at all. Lower 
or raise the significance a little, by x0.5 to x1.5, based 
on the difficulty of the challenge. Of course, don’t use 
this to punish particular party members if they have an 
advantage due to type or similar – this should be used to 
consider more sweeping advantages based on numbers 
or Level differences.
Regulating Experience
As written, Experience can only be distributed to 
Pokémon who participated directly in an encounter, 
and it can be split however the player sees fit, even if that 
means putting all of the Experience for a large encounter 
into a single Pokémon. Note that unlike in the video 
games, Fainted Pokémon can still gain Experience.
In some cases, however, such as boss encounters that 
mark the end of a major plot arc or chapter in your 
campaign, you could choose to allow a portion of the 
Experience being handed out to be distributed even to 
Pokémon that didn’t participate in battle. 
This is especially useful if you’ll be using timeskips in 
your campaign. It’s also a handy tool to allow players to 
catch up weaker Pokémon without wasting session time 
looking for Pidgeys to “grind” on. 
On the other hand, you may want to regulate how much 
Experience can be put into any single Pokémon after 
an encounter, even if it was a Pokémon that was used 
in that battle. (Letting one Pokémon on a PC’s team 
greatly outstrip the average Pokémon Level in a party 
is a bad idea!) You could institute a rule that Pokémon 
above a certain Level can only receive up to a certain 
cap of Experience from the encounter, for instance or 
simply put a flat cap on how much Experience any one 
Pokémon can receive. This can result in a player having 
too much Experience to allocate properly if they only 
used one or two Pokémon in a battle, so you should 
combine this with the above guideline for allowing non-
participant Pokémon to gain Experience as well when 
used in very large encounters.

In Pokémon Tabletop United, there are two ways for 
Trainers to gain levels; Milestones and Experience.
Milestones are the most straight forward way of leveling 
up. A Milestone represents meeting a significant goal. 
For example, gaining a Badge or a Ribbon in a contest 
should be causes for a Milestone Level-Up. Other events 
such as defeating a major opponent or very challenging 
“boss”, or fulfilling a long-term goal that impacts the 
narrative, should also grant Milestone Level-Ups, 
subject to GM discretion. 
Here’s a sample list of other Milestones you can use for 
campaigns without a Pokémon League or characters 
who have no interest in the League.
High Seas Pirate Campaign: +1 Level for each island 
fully explored or enemy flagship raided and looted.
Space Opera Campaign: +1 Level for each planet 
explored and catalogued for the fleet.
Pokémon World War Campaign: +1 Level for each 
enemy city conquered or major encampment destroyed.
Noir Detective Campaign: +1 Level for each mob boss 
taken down or arrested. 
The other way to Level Up is from gaining Experience. 
Whenever a Trainer reaches 10 Experience or higher, 
they immediately subtract 10 Experience from their 
Experience Bank and gain 1 Level. Leveling Up through 
a Milestone does not affect your Experience Bank.
There is only one automatic source of experience: 
Pokémon. Whenever a Trainer catches, hatches, or 
evolves a Pokémon species they did not previously own, 
they gain +1 Experience.
Note: Not all characters will want to catch a lot of 
Pokémon, so it may be a good idea to create alternate 
Experience goal posts for other characters. You would 
likely keep Experience from capturing Pokémon for 
the Capture Specialist since they will do this activity 
frequently and need to be rewarded for it. However, 
for another character, they gain no Experience from 
captures, but you might say they gain 3 Experience 
every time they compete in a tournament, on top of the 
Experience the group would normally gain from those 
sessions. Scale these rewards to how often you think 
they will occur in comparison to capturing Pokémon.
You may even decide to do this replacement with 
Milestones as well to create custom advancement goal 
posts for everyone. The League battler certainly might 
benefit from Gym Badges as Milestones, but you may 
decide a detective instead arrests criminal Team admins 
and officers as their Milestones.
All other Experience must be granted by the GM, and 
it is up to the GM to decide when to grant experience, 
and how much, and thus decide the pace of leveling for 
the campaign.
Calculating Trainer 
Experience
Like with Pokémon Experience, GMs will have to 
decide how much Trainer Experience to grant after each 
encounter; and again, we encourage GMs to consider 
narrative significance and challenge as the main 
determining factors.
A scuffle with weak or average wild Pokémon shouldn’t 
be worth any Trainer experience most of the time. An 
average encounter with other Trainers or with stronger 
wild Pokémon usually merits 1 or 2 Experience at most.
Significant battles that do not quite merit a Milestone 
award by themselves should award 3, 4, or even 5 
Experience. Alternatively, “lost” battles that would 
have otherwise awarded a Milestone Level-Up may be 
worth 1 or 2 Experience as well, or even more if it is a 
significant and non-repeatable event.
Experience for Trainers can and should also come from 
non-combat goals and achievements as well, both as a 
party as an individuals.
As a party, non-combat goals could include narrative 
progress, such as reaching a new Town or Route, or 
unraveling a bit of political intrigue. If nothing else, if 
you have session that has little in the way of action or 
intrigue, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to grant your party +1 
Experience for the session anyway.
As individuals, you probably should not give out too 
much experience too often unless you’re using the 
alternate Experience goal posts method, but don’t be 
shy about giving it for particular achievements. For 
example, the Ace Trainer that finally got its unruly 
Camerupt to follow orders deserves a little Experience.

Money Matters
Giving your Trainers money can sometimes be a bit 
tricky. In the ideal situation, you want to keep most of 
your PCs poor enough that they need to constantly be 
on the lookout for sources of income; but you also want 
them to have enough money to purchase basic needs, 
and indulge occasional splurges. Here are some helpful 
ideas or guidelines that may be of use.
Wagers:  Other trainers that travel the region may 
occasionally challenge your PCs to battles. Usually, 
they’ll make a wager, agreed on by both parties. 
Whoever wins gets both sides of the wager. Simple. 
Young, inexperienced trainers often don’t have much 
cash to wager; maybe 2000 at a high bid, but usually 
much lower. Older, richer, and more experienced 
trainers may wager up to 5000 however.
Contests & Gym Battles: If your Campaign involves 
Pokémon Gyms, let Gyms grant money without the risk 
of a wager. A reward of 4,000 to 8,000 or even more is 
probably in order – and of course, a TM as well! Contests 
may give similar rewards, perhaps giving a Held Item 
instead of a TM.
Parents: Parents or other family members may wish 
to help a little bit financially! They may send money, 
coupons, or vouchers electronically.
Promotions & Raffles: Like real-life stores, PokéMarts 
and PokéCenters may sometimes run promotional 
offers. Punch Cards for every 100 spent that grant 500 
in credit for 10 punches might be a nice way to help 
trainers keep up on Potions and other basic necessities. 
Occasional Raffles for free items may also be nice; on 
every purchase over 2000 for example, let them make 
a 1d20 roll; upon success, they win a nice Poké Ball or 
Restorative item of your choice.
Side Jobs: In the grand tradition of RPGs, side quests 
are always a good source of income! The amount 
awarded should be consistent with the difficulty or 
danger of the task. Some players may also wish to sell 
goods or services, such as items they can craft or the use 
of Features from Mentor and similar Classes.
The Ground: The floor can be a great ally to your PCs! 
If you feel your trainers are having trouble keeping 
their inventories stocked, once per route, let them make 
a 1d20 Luck Roll, and grant them items based on the 
result. Here’s a chart that may help – feel free to change 
the chart as little or as much as you wish.

Creating Shops
Stumped on what kinds of shops to fill your world with? 
Here are 7 ideas for types of shops that will fit most 
Pokémon worlds and towns. 
Commonly available products will show up in a store 
in most any town, save perhaps for very out of the 
way areas. Products that are “Possibly” available are 
less common and may be in stock only due to the 
surrounding environment, such as a Travel Shop near 
a cave stocking Dark Vision Goggles. “Rarely” available 
items are usually the providence of more specialized or 
especially large shops, such as the department stores 
found in cities like Goldenrod and Celadon. 
Feel free to mix and match products across rarity levels 
to best suit your setting and the shops in your world. 
PokéMarts
Commonly: Basic Balls, one or two Specialty Poké Balls 
Possibly: Great Balls, two or more Specialty Poké 
Balls, Held Items worth $2500 or less, one to three 
Evolutionary Stones or Keepsakes, one to three TMs

Held Items worth $2500 or more, large selection of 
Evolutionary Stones and Keepsakes, large selection of 
TMs

Potions, 
Antidotes, 
Awakenings, Burn Heals, Ice Heals, First Aid Kit, 
Chemistry Set, Repels

Very Rarely: Pester Balls
Travel Shop
Commonly: All items listed in the “Travel Gear” section, 
Repels, Cooking Set, Dowsing Rod, Poké Ball Tool Box, 
Portable Grower, Snow Boots, Running Shoes, Flippers, 
Jungle Boots, Old Rods, Hand Nets

Tutors and Other Services
Occasionally, your players may want access to a 
service provided by Class Features – a Move Tutor, for 
example,or perhaps a breeder. The availability for these 
services depends on you, and you should consider your 
setting before making any service available.
That said, below are some of the more common NPC 
services accompanied by recommended frequencies of 
availability and prices. 
Commonly available services probably can be given out 
pretty freely without hurting anything. “Possibly” and 
“Rarely” available services should be considered a bit 
more before inserting them into your setting. Also note, 
you should of course mix and match across rarity levels 
as it suits you; A breeder with Master Rank Pokémon 
Education could only have Rattatas and Pidgeys for 
adoption, for example.
Specialist Tutors: These Tutors have taken the 
“Tutoring” Feature, and can teach only a single specific 
Move to Pokémon that could learn that Move via Level-
Up, TM, Egg-Move list, or Move Tutor. Having one of 
these per town can be an interesting way to keep players 
looking forward to new locations. Prices should vary 
from $1000 to $3000, depending on the strength of the 
Move in question. 
Generalist Tutors: These Tutors have taken Mentor 
Features, and are rarer than Specialist Tutors and often 
more expensive, but can provide varied services. 
Commonly: Latent Potential ($800)
Possibly: Move Tutor (Varies Per Move), Corrective 
Learning ($1200)
Rarely: Changing Viewpoints ($2500), Versatile 
Teachings ($2500)
Chefs:  Rare gourmet foods are relatively common in 
big cities in restaurants, food stalls, and cafes. However, 
they are often sold at a significant mark-ups. Items such 
as Vitamins and Refreshments are usually sold at their 
normal market price.
Commonly: Super Bait ($400), Vile Bait ($400), Honey 
Candy ($150), Stat Suppressants ($500)
Possibly: Salty Surprise and Similar ($600), Preserves 
(Matches Price of original item)
Rarely: Dumplings (Combined Item Price + $500)
Fashionistas: Oh baby! Salons are common in big 
cities, and their services widely available - if pricy. Their 
makeovers will last until your next extended rest.
Commonly: Stylish Makeover ($1000)
Rarely: Elaborate Masquerade ($1000)
Breeders: These are very rare. The difference between 
various Breeders are their Skill Rank in Pokémon 
Education which affects which traits they can control 
when Breeding, and the Eggs or young Pokémon 
they offer for adoption. You may want to consider the 
presence and availability of Breeders in your game very 
carefully.
Commonly: Adept Pokémon Education, Common and 
cute Pokémon such as Rattata, Sentret, Pidgey, Lillipup, 
etc. ($1000)  
Possibly: Expert Rank Education, Slightly Rarer 
Pokémon such as Pichu, Sandshrew, or Poliwag ($5000) 
Rarely: Master Rank Education, “Starter” Pokémon or 
other rare breeds ($10,000 or more).
Very Rarely: Stronger or Rare Pokémon ($15,000 or 
more)
As a final note, some of these services such as Move 
Tutoring or Hatching Pokémon Eggs may also be good 
options to offer as prizes for defeating a Gym Leader.

Setting Skill Check Difficulties
Some basic ideas for setting difficulties for Skill Checks were touched upon earlier in the book, but here’s a more 
thorough and mathematically rigorous treatment of the subject, if that’s your thing. 
First of all, here’s a mathematical breakdown of percentage chance of success for a given DC a +0 modifer applied 
to the raw Skill Check. Trainers will often have Equipment, Edges that give them bonus modifiers to their Skills, 
and other effects which will give them higher probabilities for success than these baseline values might indicate. 
Be sure to account for that when setting DCs.
If you need to see the chances of success/failure for a specific Trainer, then simply adjust the DC to account for 
the difference in their modifier. For every point above +0, subtract 1 from the DC. For example, a Trainer making 
a DC 14 Athletics check with a +4 modifier to theirAthletics from equipment and other effects would have the 
chances associated with DC 10 on the chart. So 84.1% at Adept, 50% at Novice, and 16.67% at Untrained. 
DC 4 - 90%+ success rate at Untrained or higher, 50% success rate at Pathetic
DC 6 - 90%+ success rate at Novice or higher, 72.22% at Untrained, 16.67% success rate at Pathetic
DC 8 - 83.8% success rate at Novice, 41.67% at Untrained, impossible at Pathetic
DC 10 - 84.1% success rate at Adept, 50% at Novice, 16.67% at Untrained
DC 12 - 90%+ success rate at Expert or higher, 76.08% at Adept, 37.5% at Novice, 2.78% at Untrained
DC 14 - 84.8% success rate at Expert, 55.63% at Adept, 16.2% at Novice, impossible at Untrained
DC 16 - 90%+ success rate at Master, 69.48% at Expert, 33.56% at Adept, 4.63% at Novice
DC 18 - 79.42% at Master, 50% at Expert, 15.9% at Adept, less than 1% at Novice
DC 20 - 63.69% at Master, 30.52% at Expert, 5.4% at Adept, impossible at Novice
DC 22 - 45.43% at Master, 15.2% at Expert, 1.16% at Adept
DC 24 - 27.94% at Master, 5.88% at Expert, less than 1% at Adept
DC 26 - 14.46% at Master, 3.24% at Expert, impossible at Adept
DC 28 - 6.08% at Master, less than 1% at Expert
DC 30 - 1.97% at Master
That said, here’s an easy breakdown – the following DCs 
represent the average roll for a Skill Check at these DCs. 
Use them when you want the PCs to succeed most of the 
time but still want a chance for failure. You should also 
frequently increase them by a couple points for more 
difficult situations, especially because most characters 
will have bonus modifers to their specialty Skills.
Untrained check – DC 7 
Novice check – DC 10
Adept check – DC 13
Expert check – DC 17 
Master check – DC 21
Armed with these percentages, or simply the easy 
breakdown if you wish, you can decide how difficult to 
make the Skill Checks in your campaign! First of all, 
what kind of tone are you going for in your campaign?
If you’re emulating the Pokémon anime, then DCs may 
tend toward the easy side. Leaps of faith from building 
tops to passing airships and hot-air balloons may be 
difficult but doable even for relatively inexperienced 
(Novice) acrobats, say, a DC of 12 or 14. Essentially, 
“anime physics” are in play, and Trainers can expect 
for acts of heroism to have moderately high chances of 
success. 
Now, if you were running a gritty noir campaign, or 
a downtrodden post-apocalyptic campaign, you may 
decide the overall tone is grimmer, making Skill Checks 
more difficult. That same jump could easily be a DC 
20 Acrobatics Check, representing the difficulty of 
accurately leaping from a building to a quickly moving 
airship. With more realistic physics in play, Trainers will 
have to be careful what risks they take.

Second, think about what each level of Skill Rank 
represents in your campaign. For example, generally, 
Adept Rank is enough for someone to make a living by 
their Skill. 
So when considering whether or not one of your 
PCs with an Adept Education: Technology Skill can 
successfully repair a car engine in a shop, think about 
whether or not the problem is one they’d be able to 
routinely handle at any given car mechanic you’d visit. 
Simply replacing a part? At DC 10, even someone 
without bonuses from equipment and other modifiers 
would succeed an overwhelming amount of the time 
with an Adept Skill. If it’s a more esoteric problem 
involving a rarer model of car? At DC 17, even someone 
with a +3 total modifier from Categoric Inclination and 
Skill Enhancement and an Adept Skill in Technology is 
only going to be able to solve the problem a little over 
half the time – and that might be accurate. 
It could be the kind of problem that gets the chief 
mechanic called in at the shop or requires further 
research and special equipment that might give a bonus 
to the Skill Check on a later reattempt.
We don’t really believe in handing out tables of set DCs 
for particular tasks, but hopefully, having these numbers 
on hand and this guide will allow you to properly set 
DCs for Skill Checks in a variety of campaign types!
Circumstantial Difficulties
When deciding the difficulty for a Skill Check, the target 
number depends on the difficulty of the task itself, but 
Skill Checks aren’t done in a vacuum. The environment 
and other external circumstances will affect the difficulty 
of a task. However, trying to map different activities to a 
scale of DCs that range from the single digits up to 30+ 
is a daunting task, and it can be hard to conceptualize 
that wide a range. It can seem like once players rank up 
their skills to a certain point, they can’t fail at anything 
anymore.
The recommended solution here is to apply penalty dice 
to checks in severe circumstances. For each mitigating 
circumstance that makes a task more difficult, roll 1d6 
and subtract that amount from the character’s Skill 
Check. For example, you might set the difficulty for a 
Perception Check to spy a hidden scroll in the nook of a 
tree at 12. A character with Adept Perception and a +2 
bonus from Skill Enhancement would easily make this 
check most of the time as they’d average a roll of 16. 
However, if they’re making this check while in the dark 
and during a violent rainstorm with high speed winds 
blowing, you may decide to roll two penalty dice against 
their check in addition to the DC you set for the task. 
This makes it easier to create difficult tasks for highly 
skilled characters without needing to conceptualize an 
enormous range of DCs.
The reason penalty dice are rolled instead of merely 
subtracting d6s from the player’s roll is that we wanted 
to avoid situations where a player literally could not roll 
a check because all of their dice have been subtracted 
due to circumstantial modifiers. While it is exceedingly 
unlikely that a player might succeed in a roll where the 
penalty dice equal or exceed the dice they would roll for 
a check, it’s still possible, and they should have a chance 
to attempt that roll.

Shiny Pokémon 
“Shiny Pokémon” is a catch-all term for Pokémon with 
unusual characteristics. 
The most common kind of Shiny Pokémon are the kind 
that simply have a Shiny Color.  Most commonly, this 
is a result of a minor genetic abnormality that simply 
changes the color of a Pokémon’s fur, scales, or similar 
outer coatings without additional effect. Nonetheless, 
these Pokémon are valued highly by collectors and 
will often draw notice in Contests; they may roll +2d6 
during the Introduction Stage. Shiny Pokémon should 
also give their trainer more cachet when attempting to 
trade the Pokémon.
Rarer “Shiny Pokémon” are usually the result of an en-
vironmental adaptation or more extreme genetic muta-
tion. These Pokémon may have Abilities, Capabilities, 
or a Moveset different from other Pokémon of their 
Species – some may even be of a different Type.  They 
may exhibit one or more of these capabilities.
 
For example, a Shiny Ninetales found in the ruins of a 
burned haunted house might be Fire/Ghost Type, have 
Pressure as an ability choice, have the Phasing capability, 
or have Moves such as Shadow Ball in its level-up Move 
List.
 
Even rarer still are Shiny Pokémon which have custom 
traits such as changes to their Base Stats, completely 
custom Features, or homebrew Moves. The writers of 
the system recommend using these two brands of rare 
Shiny Pokémon sparingly in most settings so as to avoid 
overshadowing the normal Pokémon the players have.
Examples of Shiny Pokémon
Below we’ve outlined a few example shiny Pokémon to 
get your creative juices flowing. Listed in order from a 
“Minor” Shiny to more significant “Shininess”. 
Punchy Sentret – This Sentret somehow learned the 
Move Dizzy Punch! How about that?
Cave Breloom – This stark white Breloom was found 
deep in a cavern, lightless save from the eerie pale 
glow of the mushroom Pokémon there. It has the Glow 
Capability.
Heart-Spot Spinda – This Spinda’s spots are all shaped 
like hearts! These seem to give her a strange power; 
they glow whenever she uses the Move Attract, and she 
can successfully use that Move on any Pokémon, even 
genderless Pokémon.
Muscle Audino – This Fighting-Type Audino is super 
hulky! Its base Defense and Special Defense are each 
lowered by -3, but its Attack is increased by +6! Its 
Power Capability is increased by +3 as well! It’s capable 
of learning all Fighting Type TMs, but its natural Move 
list remains physically … unimpressive.
Pacifist Chimecho – This Chimecho refuses to hurt 
others and isn’t even capable of learning Moves that 
hurt enemies – not even Confusion! Even teaching it 
offensive Status Moves like Toxic seems to fail! It knows 
Wish, Light Screen, and Reflect from the start, however.
Crystal Onix – This Onix is made of glass! Its 
typing is Glass/Ground. The Glass Type’s Elemental 
weaknesses and resistances are listed below, as are the 
final resistances of a Glass/Ground Onix. Glass-Type 
Pokémon gain STAB on Rock-Type Moves.
Raikou-Bred Manectric – It seems like one of this 
Manectric’s parents was a Raikou! It has the flowing 
cape-like purple fur of a Raikou coming from the back of 
its head, and its tail is identical to a Raikou’s. Its natural 
Move List is a combination of Raikou and Manectric’s, 
drawing from both directly, and its choice of Abilities 
similarly may draw from Raikou’s list in addition to 
Manectric’s.
Giant Caterpie – This Caterpie is the size of a Rhyhorn! 
Increase its Base Stats by +6 across the board! Its Power 
is increased by +3, its Overland Speed is increased by 
+4, and its Jump Capabilities by +2. It knows the Moves 
Tackle, String Shot, Bug Bite, Thrash, Body Slam, and 
Megahorn! However, for some reason, it can’t seem to 
evolve no matter what you do…
Glass Type 
Immune: Water
Resist: Normal, Ice, 
Poison
Weak: Fire, Fighting, 
Ground, Rock, Steel
Glass/Ground
Immune: Water, Electric
Resist: Normal, Flying
Double Resist: Poison
Weak: Fire, Grass, 
Fighting, Ground, Steel

Type Changes
As a result of a Type Ace’s Features or perhaps simply 
because you’re making a Type-shifted Shiny Pokémon 
to throw at your players, you may have to deal with 
Moves and Pokémon that have changed Type.
Changing Move Type
Permanently changing a Move’s Type with Move Sync 
may change the effects of the move, sometimes severely. 
For example, an Ice Beam that is made to be Fire Type 
should probably no longer have a chance to cause 
Freezing - Burn would be an appropriate substitute. A 
Dark-Type Sunny Day would perhaps cause a Dark Day 
instead - raising the power of Dark Type Moves, and 
lowering the power of Psychic Type Moves.
These are mere suggestions, and the effects of each 
Move after Move Sync are up to the individual GM. Be 
creative, and don’t change the viability or power level 
of the move too significantly. Do not change effects if 
the effect doesn’t seem very inappropriate for the type; 
Thunderbolt could still paralyze, for example, if it were 
shifted to Normal, Ghost, Dark, Grass, Psychic and 
many other types.
And most importantly, change the name of the Move 
after it’s been Type Sync’d! That Ghost-Type Thunderbolt 
may turn into Spiritbolt, for example.
Pokémon Type Change
Type Sync (found in the fantasy and sci-fi supplement 
books) permanently changes a Pokémon’s Type to 
match a Trainer’s Elemental Connection. Changing a 
Pokémon’s Type has several effects;
First and most obvious, the actual Type is changed. You 
can either add the Chosen Type to an existing Type, 
or replace a Type with your Chosen Type. You cannot 
cause a Pokémon to have more than two types in this 
way, but you can:
1.	 Turn a Mono-Typed Pokémon into a Dual Typed 
Pokémon with both its original Typing and your 
chosen Type.
2.	 Turn a Mono-Typed Pokémon into a Mono-Typed 
Pokémon of your chosen Type. 
3.	 Cause a Dual-Typed Pokémon to become a Dual-
Typed Pokémon with your chosen type replacing 
one of its original types. If you use Type Sync on a 
Dual-Typed Pokémon that is already of your chosen 
type, it loses its additional Typing and becomes a 
Mono-Typed Pokémon of your chosen Type.
Secondly, the Pokémon can generally learn TMs, HMs, 
and Move Tutor Moves of that Type. It should be able 
to learn MOST moves that match its new Types, but 
there may be exceptions; just like Steelix can’t learn Steel 
Wing, some Pokémon may not be able to learn some 
Moves that match its new Type. This is up to your GM.
Third, the Pokémon’s Capabilities change to match its 
new Type. It gains Capabilities associated with its new 
type; Firestarter and Heater for Fire Types, Gilled and 
Fountain for Water Types, etc. The exact Capabilities 
gained are up to the GM. If the Pokémon lost a Type, 
it similarly loses the Capabilities associated with its 
former Type.
Fourth, the Pokémon’s Ability may change. It may not. 
A Flying/Poison Gengar probably shouldn’t retain 
Levitate; a Dark/Poison Gengar could. Abilities that are 
very generally indicative of a Type, such as Volt Absorb 
or Flame Body, should probably not be kept – however, 
there are always exceptions. It may be worthwhile to be 
more lenient on weaker Pokémon over Pokémon that 
are already very strong.
And Fifth, a Pokémon’s Level-Up Move List will change. 
This is a delicate process that is up to the GM. Generally, 
the thought process for altering a Level-Up List should 
be as such: Was a Type replaced? Moves of that Type 
on the Move-List should be changed to that of the new 
Type. If those moves are very sparse, consider changing 
a few other moves of another Type to the New Type 
as well. If no Type was replaced, convert some moves 
of a Type the Pokémon doesn’t have to the new Type; 
often, many Normal-Type moves will be available for 
this. Generally, you should turn a Move into a different 
move of the Chosen Type with the same Frequency and 
power level.

Fluffing Type Changes
The Fluff of changing a Pokémon’s type can be tricky. 
Some Types seem made for it – the Ghost Ace who 
performs an ancient and eldritch ritual on their 
Pokémon to take them beyond death. Some Types … 
not so much. How do you explain a Pokémon suddenly 
becoming a Normal Type?
This is up to the GM! Here are a couple of ideas to get 
your started:
1.	 Pokémon are inherently mutable and unstable 
creatures. The easiest way to explain a sudden 
Type Change is to exploit this aspect of Pokémon. 
As a GM, you might require a Type-Change to be 
performed as a Pokémon is evolving; during this 
mysterious process, due to their Trainer’s inherent 
connection to a Type, the Pokémon changes their 
own form to match.
2.	 Single-Staged or Fully Evolved Pokémon may go 
through this same process, SEEMING to evolve –
they glow, change shape slightly, and then wow, they 
have a new type!
3.	 Look at the Trainer’s other classes. A Type Ace / 
Researcher could perhaps concoct a strange and 
powerful potion. A Hex Maniac or Channeler would 
be a natural candidate for performing strange and 
unknowable rituals.
4.	 A Wizard did it. No, seriously; maybe the PCs have 
to visit a particular NPC and use their powers/
super-advanced machine to effect a change in their 
Pokémon. Perhaps they have to visit an obscure and 
remote shrine. If the PCs in your game travel often, 
perhaps there are various of these wizard/machine/
shrines throughout the region.
Whichever method you choose to employ, keep these 
things in mind:
The way in which the GM chooses to implement Type-
Sync could affect the requirements and action-type of 
Type Sync, but we strongly recommend making these 
FLUFF requirements rather than overtly mechanical 
ones.
Saying your trainer has to spend some time creating a 
Potion or setting up a ritual is alright – making it so they 
have to spend a big chunk of their available funds to do 
so is probably too mean. If you choose to have an NPC 
or location be involved in the process, these shouldn’t 
be places that are very hard to reach; you probably do 
not want to limit the opportunities to use their Features 
too harshly.
All of these options will of course vary by the campaign.
Example Type Change
4 Tail Whip - Normal
9 Ember - Fire
13 Flame Wheel - Fire
17 Stomp - Normal
21 Flame Charge - Fire
25 Fire Spin - Fire

A Fighting Ace / Researcher performs mad science to give his 
Rapidash big muscley arms, shifting it from Fire Type to Fighting

Mega Evolution and End-Game Pokémon
Late in a campaign or as the PCs are finalizing their 
main teams, the players will often want to seek out truly 
impressive Pokémon to finish off their teams. Much 
of the time, this will simply mean seeking out a rare 
“pseudo-legendary” Pokémon such as Dragonite or 
Metagross, but players will also often express interest 
in Mega Evolutions and even Legendary Pokémon. 
How should a GM handle these quests and make them 
properly challenging and meaningful? 
Trainers will often have to prove themselves worthy 
of such a Pokémon rather than attempting to catch it 
outright. This is particularly the case for Mega Evolutions 
where a Trainer probably already owns the Pokémon of 
the species they’d like to Mega Evolve but must obtain 
both a Mega Ring and the appropriate Mega Stone. 
The Mega Ring itself can be portrayed as advanced 
technology or a mystical artifact. Either way, it is 
likely kept under guard by an elite group charged with 
determining when Trainers are ready to handle a Mega 
Ring. The test can be anything from a Gym Challenge 
or series of battle challenges to trials that more broadly 
test a Trainer’s competence or their ethics and character. 
You may even mix these up and combine them. 
For example, a Trainer might be tasked with retrieving an 
artifact from an ancient ruin to prove their competence. 
However, upon arriving at the ruins and battling 
through the Pokémon within, they discover the artifact 
and reach out for it – and when they touch it, they 
are sent into a dream-like trance where they’re thrust 
into hypothetical situations that test their strength of 
character and ethical integrity. 
Such trials are useful not only for giving Trainers Mega 
Rings but for granting entry to caves where rare or 
Legendary Pokémon make their home. 
Of course, to achieve Mega Evolution, a Trainer needs 
not only a Mega Ring but the appropriate Mega Stone 
for their Pokémon. 
You will have to first decide what exactly a Mega Stone 
is. They may be similar to Elemental Stones that are 
used to Evolve Pokémon, just with an affinity to a single 
species rather than several. You may decide they are 
the byproducts of world-changing supernatural events, 
such as the leftover crystallized bits of life energy from 
an act by Xerneas or Yveltal. You may decide they are 
man-made, and a specific ritual or machine can create 
them when powered by the bond of friendship between 
Trainer and Pokémon. 
What a Mega Stone is will determine what a Trainer has 
to do to acquire one. If they’re ancient relics or simply 
naturally occurring stones, you may have the PCs go 
ruin-diving or spelunking to find their Mega Stones. 
It could be a good idea in these cases to put them in 
areas where the particular species for the Mega Stone is 
commonly found, or where they were found in antiquity, 
for the case of ruins. If they’re man-made, then it’s likely 
that whoever provided them with the Mega Ring also 
has the ability to manufacture Mega Stones. 
The proper timing for introducing a quest to acquire the 
equipment for Mega Evolution, a Legendary Pokémon, 
or other rare and powerful Pokémon is up to you. A 
good guideline for when to make Mega Evolution 
available is when most of the PCs’ teams are at least 5-10 
Levels past their final Evolutionary Stages. Obviously, if 
everyone has largely Pokémon that evolve very late or 
very early, this isn’t as useful of a metric. 
Requiring in-game research or basing qualification on 
a number of Gym Badges is another way to pace out 
the beginning of this type of quest. For finding an area 
to catch lower-leveled pseudo-legendary Pokémon, 
all it might take is some research and a dangerous 
trip out to their natural habitats. For gaining access to 
Mega Evolution or the homes of Legendary Pokémon, 
a Trainer might need anywhere from 4-8 Gym Badges 
depending on the pace of your campaign.

Building a full character in Pokémon Tabletop United 
can be pretty time consuming. If you try to build every 
NPC just as you could build a PC, then you’ll quickly 
find yourself swamped by a lot of work for very little 
gain. Instead, you should give most NPCs just the bare 
minimum of what they need to function, especially if 
you don’t foresee using them in combat. 
By all means, spend the time to write out full builds for 
major NPCs that will be showing up often, but most 
NPCs don’t need that treatment.
Use the following process to quickly generate NPCs:
Decide on Level. The easiest way to do this is simply 
by reference to the PCs’ Levels. Is your NPC generally 
more experienced than the PCs or less? By how much? 
While you may not use this directly when doing quick 
stats for an NPC, it’s good to have an idea of the Level 
difference between the NPC and the PCs.
Choose major Classes and Features. You should have 
a general idea of what kind of archetype this NPC 
represents or what role you expect to play in the story. 
Based on this, pick a small handful of Features you know 
they need, including Class Features. Unless they’re at 
a very low Level, you don’t really have to worry about 
whether they can gain all of these. For Combat Trainers, 
focus on the Moves and Abilities they’ll use in battle.
Choose major Skills and Edges. Look at the Features 
you chose in the previous step. Mark down any Skill 
prerequisites for your NPC and any Edges they may 
need as well. Then, if you feel there’s more to the NPC 
not represented here between the Features, Edges, and 
Skills, add the missing Skills and Edges within reason. 
Don’t give an NPC everything, but if you build a quick 
Martial Artist / Ace Trainer but remember he’s supposed 
to be a gadget whiz too, it wouldn’t hurt to bump up his 
Technology Education to Adept or so. 
(Optional) Distribute Combat Stats. Starting Trainers 
have 10 HP and 5 in the rest of their Combat Stats. They 
then add 10 points on top of that. A fully non-combat 
Trainer will then have an additional stat point for 
each Level past 1. A fully combat focused Trainer has 
twice that due to Stat Tags. Add Stat Points somewhere 
between those extremes as appropriate.
Example: A GM is preparing a Poké Ball crafter and 
wilderness guide who lives in a shack outside the woods 
the PCs are preparing to explore. Here’s the quick 
process for making this NPC.
Decide on Level: The PCs are all about Level 10, having 
gotten a few Gym Badges under their belt along with 
the other exploring they’ve done. The GM decides 
his crafter is somewhat more experienced than them, 
having spent his life traveling the region. He sets his 
Level at 15. 
Choose major Classes and Features: Poké Ball Crafter 
is crucial to this concept of course. This means he has 
Poké Ball Repair too. On the wilderness guide side of 
the concept, the GM decides this guy has the Survivalist 
Class and Hunter Classes from dealing with the wilds 
nearby. Because he’s good at dealing with the rough 
weather around this area too, he gives him Researcher 
and the Climatology Field of Study.
Choose major Skills and Edges: The GM first looks 
over the prerequisites for the Features he’s chosen and 
bumps up his NPC’s Technology Education to Expert, 
General Education to Novice, Stealth to Novice, and 
Survival to Adept. Since he’s good with Pokémon and 
a researcher, he goes ahead and writes down Novice 
Charm and Pokémon Education for the NPC too. 
(Optional) Distribute Combat Stats: While the GM 
was just planning to make his NPC a guide through the 
forest and a source of information, his session takes an 
interesting turn, and he thinks he’ll need to have the 
guy participate in a battle with wild Pokémon the PCs 
provoked. 
He writes down 10 HP and 5 in the rest of his NPC’s 
Combat Stats. Noting he’s a guy who can take a hit, 
he puts 5 more points into HP and 5 into Defense. He 
then thinks about how many more Stat Points he’ll 
have. Hunter will give some HP and Speed Stat Tags, 
but he’s also a Researcher. A fully combat ready Trainer 
has 28 additional Stat Points at Level 15. A fully non-
combat Trainer has 14. Since this NPC is somewhere in 
between, the GM gives him 20 Stat Points, 10 of which 
he puts in Speed, and 5 each in HP and Special Defense.

Encounter Creation Guide
What’s probably the most time consuming part of being 
a GM is putting together all the combat encounters 
your players will face off against. This doesn’t have to 
be a painful process though, and you should have fun 
coming up with unique and interesting encounters for 
your players. Here’s a guide for doing just that.
Setting Up the Encounter
The first step to crafting a combat encounter is figuring 
out why the players will be fighting. A lot of the advice 
in this particular section won’t necessarily be exclusive 
to combat encounters, however, and can be helpful in 
crafting non-combat events and activities for the players 
to engage with. 
It’s easy enough to come up with most League-affiliated 
or plot-centric encounters. Having to challenge a Gym 
Leader for a badge or enter a qualifying tournament for 
the Pokémon League is pretty universal to campaigns 
with that kind of structure. Pitting your players against 
Team Rocket or your own custom criminal team is also 
straightforward.  
When your players are traveling between towns, however, 
it can be boring to always have a pack of wild Pokémon 
ambush them for no reason simply so you can give 
the players something to fight and catch. Carnivorous 
Pokémon may see Trainers as food, but you don’t always 
have the luxury of building an encounter around those 
species. Here are some common scenarios where your 
players might get into a scuffle with the local wildlife.
There’s an ongoing fight between Pokémon on the 
road. This can range from Sevipers and Zangoose 
duking it out to a pack of Mighyenas hunting prey like 
Buneary. In many cases, Trainers will simply leave such 
fights alone, but you’d be surprised how many PCs 
will want to intercede on nature running its course, 
especially if cute and fluffy Pokémon are in danger. 
Alternatively, a conflict could be so large that it’s 
impossible to cross a part of the route without cutting 
a path through and getting caught in the crossfire. As 
a twist, you may have a pack of wild Pokémon hunting 
another wounded Trainer or group of Trainers as prey, 
even if the local wildlife wouldn’t normally go after 
healthy Trainers.
Pokémon are protecting something valuable. Most 
wild Pokémon will leave Trainers alone, but if they’re 
guarding eggs, children, or wounded members of their 
pack, they may act more aggressively. Pokémon can 
also often be intensely territorial, but this rarely results 
in a fight unless the PCs don’t know they’re intruding 
or if they have a compelling reason to willfully go into 
dangerous territory. So pair this with the territory or 
valuables being guarded being in the direct path of 
the PCs, and you have a good formula for getting the 
players involved in a fight or at least making a difficult 
choice how to proceed. 
If a storm is approaching while the players are hiking up 
a treacherous mountain, and the only shelter available 
is a cave system guarded by a Druddigon taking care of 
her eggs, what do the players do? 
Pokémon are agitated by an external source. A Team 
Rocket radio broadcast might be riling up the wildlife, or 
perhaps a group of poachers has set the local Pokémon 
population on edge. This is a good way to draw the PCs 
into a larger plot too, if you wish.

Basic Encounter Creation Guidelines
With the ease and simplicity of PTU’s rules for giving out 
Experience (page 460), one great method for creating 
encounters is to work backwards from the Experience 
drop you want to give your players. 
One good guideline here for an everyday encounter is 
to multiply the average Pokémon Level of your PCs by 
2 (average Trainer Level x 4 works in a pinch too given 
most games maintain Pokémon Levels at twice average 
Trainer Levels) and use that as a projected baseline 
Experience drop per player for the encounter. This 
should result in about enough Experience for each player 
to get a Pokémon half a Level from the encounter. For 
very low Level parties with few Pokémon, you’ll want to 
decrease baseline Experience when using this method. 
This assumes an encounter with a Significance Multiplier 
of 1x, or insignificant. A Significance Multiplier of 2x, 
or the lower end for an everyday encounter, will double 
your baseline and nets you about enough Experience 
for a Pokémon to Level Up once. As you create a more 
important encounter, not only should you increase the 
Significance Multiplier, but you should also increase the 
baseline Experience you’re working with, as that will 
determine the Levels of the enemies you create. 
From there, simply multiply the Experience drop by 
your number of Trainers. This is the number of Levels 
you have to work with to build your encounter. 
Example: A GM is designing an encounter for three 
Level 10 Trainers, each with Pokémon around Level 
20. Multiply the average Pokémon Level by 2 for a 
baseline Experience drop of 40. Multiply this by 3 for 
the number of Trainers for a total of 120 levels to build 
an encounter. The GM splits this six ways and stats up 
an encounter with six Level 20 Pokémon. If the battle 
has an everyday Significance modifier of 2x, then each 
player gets 80 Experience and can approximately Level 
Up their Pokémon once from the battle.
For a bigger, more important, fight, the GM decides 
on a baseline Experience drop per player of 60 and a 
Significance Multiplier of 5x for a total of 300 Experience, 
enough to give several Pokémon a Level or give one or 
two Pokémon a couple of Levels. Multiplying 60 by 3 for 
the number of Trainers, the GM has 180 Levels to build 
an encounter. He splits it into two Level 40 Pokémon 
and four Level 25 Pokémon. He could also give up two 
weaker Pokémon to make a Level 25 Trainer.
For normal encounters, don’t sink all of the Levels 
you have to work with into one or two Pokémon with 
extremely high Levels! But also, Levels aren’t the only 
factor that should be affected by the Significance 
Multiplier. How well the enemies synergize, whether 
they have Egg, TM, or Tutor Moves, and how powerful 
the species are should vary as well. 
Example: Our GM from the previous example may 
create an encounter of three Cacnea and three Trapinch 
for a desert encounter in the case of six Level 20 
foes. They might not have much special, but maybe 
the Cacneas have Magical Leaf or Low Kick in their 
Inheritance Move list, and the Trapinch have Quick 
Attack to make up for their abysmal speed.
However, for the more important encounter, he uses 
Level 40 Cacturne and gives them Thunder Punch 
and Poison Jab to help cover their Flying and Fairy 
weaknesses, respectively. He also ensures they have the 
Twisted Power and Sand Veil Abilities. Three Trapinch 
support them in the encounter and have Rock Slide 
and Sandstorm. A Researcher / Cheerleader with the 
Extreme Weather Feature gives all Pokémon damaged 
by Sandstorm a penalty to accuracy rolls and uses 
Orders to boost their attacks. 
Of course, you can certainly build an encounter without 
working backwards this way. Either way, be mindful of 
what your aim for the encounter is as well. The six Level 
20s may not seriously threaten the group of Trainers 
and might just act as a tax on their resources as they 
travel, but the more significant encounter poses a real 
threat of taking them all out. 
As a final bit of advice, be 
wary of action economy! 
A large swarm of low 
Level foes can quickly 
overwhelm even the 
strongest of parties. 
It’s usually better to 
use a moderate number 
of foes than go in either 
extreme, 
though 
there 
are 
exceptions 
which 
will be noted in the more 
advanced parts of this guide.

Quick-Statting Pokémon
Just as with NPCs, you don’t always have the luxury 
(or desire) of spending hours fine-tuning a combat 
encounter. Sometimes, you just need something quick 
to throw at your players as they go exploring the 
wilderness or looking for Pokémon to catch. 
Here are some tips for on-the-fly wild Pokémon battles 
or last minute prep work. 
1. Stick to 2 or 3 different species. 
You want to clone a few Pokémon to populate your 
encounter, but you don’t want an encounter made 
entirely of one species either. Luckily, it makes logical 
sense for most Pokémon to travel in packs, and you can 
pick species which supplement the “main” species you 
select for the encounter. 
2. Pick species that are easy to stat. 
An ideal Pokémon for quickly statting an encounter has 
one attacking Stat and HP as their highest Base Stats or 
is in a position where a choice of Nature can easily make 
that the case. Pokémon with very low base HP make for 
difficult statting on the fly. 
3. Pick 3-4 Stats to focus on per Pokémon. 
If you’ve picked a fairly easy to stat species, then you 
can simply evenly divide Stat Points for the Pokémon 
among their highest 3 or 4 stats, depending on their 
specific Base Stat configuration. This will usually raise 
HP, one attack stat, and then some combination of speed 
and the defenses, making for a reasonably well-rounded 
combatant that can still hold its own. 
As an emergency option, you can grab just about any 
species, distribute Stat Points evenly across all six Stats, 
and then throw them into an encounter. Keep in mind 
though that enemies written with this method will be 
much weaker than an equivalently Leveled PC Pokémon 
almost all of the time.
Example: The players have suddenly taken a detour 
away from the beach path to the grassy plains, and 
the GM’s prepared Krabby and Crawdaunt encounter 
is now completely out of place. They’re still looking to 
catch wild Pokémon though, and so the GM needs a 
new set of stats, and quick! 
Glancing through the list of grassland Pokémon, the 
GM finds Growlithe and glances over its Base Stats. 
Attack and Special Attack are highest, followed by HP 
and Speed. Pretty good for this exercise. She tosses in an 
Arcanine as the pack leader and decides that the group 
also adopted a Herdier, to give the encounter some 
variety. 
Growlithe’s Stats are simple. The GM distributes all Stat 
Points evenly between Attack, Special Attack, HP, and 
Speed, creating a mixed attacker easily even with an 
unadjusted neutral Nature. 
She takes a quick moment to be fancier with Arcanine, 
giving it a Curious Nature to raise HP and lower Special 
Attack, making it focused on Physical attacks. She then 
distributes Stat Points evenly between HP, Attack, and 
Speed only. 
For the Herdier, a neutral Nature works as well. Stat 
Points are split between Attack, HP, and both defensive 
Stats, making it the tankier part of this encounter. 
Finally, all the GM needs to do is write down their 
Abilities and Level Up Moves and then decide on 
whether to give them an Inheritance Move or two if she’s 
getting really fancy with her hastily statted encounter. 
Running Faster Combat
Sometimes, not only do you need to stat the encounter 
quickly, but you want to run the players through it as 
quickly as possible as well. Here are a few tips for doing 
just that. 
1.	 Don’t use maps. Abstract distances instead so you 
and the players have to spend less time thinking 
about exactly which square to move to and what’s in 
range from there. 
2.	 Pre-roll Accuracy Rolls for your foes. Simply keep 
a sheet of randomly generated numbers from 1 to 20 
(either rolling manually before the session or using 
an online generator or spreadsheet) and use them in 
order for Accuracy Rolls for your enemies, crossing 
them off as you go. 
3.	 Use the set damage chart, not the rolled damage 
chart. This will save you loads of time finding the 
right dice and counting them up for damage.

The Types and Roles of Combat Encounters
This section of the encounter creation guide gets a bit 
theoretical, so if you find it boring, feel free to skip 
ahead to the next page. It’s mainly for those GMs who 
really want to think about what their aims are when they 
create a combat encounter for their players and how to 
design and execute encounters to meet those aims. 
For many veteran GMs, the advice here will seem familiar 
and broadly applicable to many tabletop roleplaying 
games, but there’s also going to be discussion of how the 
particular dynamics of PTU affect encounter creation. 
Specifically, unlike most other roleplaying systems, 
the player controls a team of varied Pokémon in PTU 
that play many roles and have individual strengths and 
weaknesses rather than a single character which is rather 
static in both role and its strengths and weaknesses.
Broadly speaking, combat encounters can do two things 
to the PCs. They can Tax them or Threaten them. 
An encounter that Taxes the PCs most likely won’t 
have a high chance of resulting in their defeat and may 
even seem to be an almost assured victory for them. 
However, what it does do is cost them resources. This 
doesn’t just mean Hit Points or the healing items used to 
recover them, but those certainly are the most obvious 
resources that are taxed. Pokémon and Trainer alike 
can become Injured, which takes a long time to heal. 
Knocked out Pokémon may present a conundrum to a 
party ill-equipped to revive them. Features and Moves 
with Daily Frequencies are expended. An encounter 
that Taxes the party makes future encounters more 
difficult until resources are recovered, and it can set up 
for an encounter meant to Threaten the PCs. 
An encounter that Threatens the PCs does just what it 
sounds like. It threatens to defeat the PCs and result in 
their demise, capture, or other form of incapacitation. 
Usually, this takes the form of a boss encounter and 
only occurs after the PCs have already been Taxed by 
other encounters or adventures. Simply put, with a full 
team of six Pokémon per PC, it’s very unlikely that a 
single encounter will take them all out from full health 
unless either 1) the enemies target down PC Trainers 
quickly while deprioritizing their Pokémon or 2) the 
encounter stretches out for a very long time. Neither of 
these situations are particularly fun when used liberally. 
So what do you do with these two types of combat 
encounters in mind? Well, that’s simple, when you sit 
down to create an encounter, think about which role 
you want it to play and tailor it accordingly. 
When you want to Tax the PCs, widespread damage 
over time such as Hail and Sandstorm are good ways of 
bringing down Hit Points over the whole party in a way 
that doesn’t threaten death but will either weaken them 
for future encounters or cost them healing resources. 
Persistent Status Afflictions also play this role well. 
Injuries are perhaps the most lasting way to Tax a party, 
and while they can be accrued naturally through the 
course of battle, throwing in enemies with Cruelty or 
similar effects can accelerate this. 
When you Threaten the PCs, you will usually be in for 
a longer encounter no matter what, unless you simply 
create enemies capable of one-shotting them, which 
is usually no fun. High damage is more important, 
however, and you may wish to use Moves such as Heal 
Block to further ramp up the danger.
Encounters meant to Threaten the PCs should typically 
be designed in concert with those that will Tax them. 
Part of this is to create interesting choices in your 
campaign – the PCs know they will almost certainly 
defeat a caravan of Team Plasma grunts they encounter 
on the road on the way to the hideout, but they also 
know it will cost them precious resources to do so that 
will hinder them in attacking the hideout. If the caravan 
is possibly holding an experimental weapon or perhaps 
kidnapped prisoners, this may become a tough decision. 
Another reason to design these encounters parallel to 
each other is that you may wish to Tax the PC party 
in particular ways before an upcoming encounter. For 
example, grunts under the command of a Fire Ace 
villain may be instructed to weaken or target down any 
Water and Rock Type Pokémon that intruders use. In 
this way, even encounters that the PCs know they will 
win for sure become dangerous – not because there is 
some chance they might lose, but because not winning 
soundly enough could cost them a future victory against 
more imposing or vital foes.

Spicing Up Encounters
Now that you’ve got the basics down, it’s time to get 
interesting. Battles don’t happen in a vacuum, or they 
shouldn’t anyway. If all of your encounters take place 
against a stock number of opponents and on a flat and 
empty plane, then your players are liable to get bored 
from the lack of tactical variety. Here are some ideas for 
mixing it up! 
Use the Environment
Consider the environment the encounter takes place in. 
A couple of simple rules for a hazardous environment 
such as traps, poor visibility, or restricted movement 
can turn what is ordinarily a mundane and easy 
encounter into a real trial for the players. You can also 
set up scenarios where the players’ actions and choices 
leading up to the encounter affect the final environment 
they fight in. This can be especially handy to make the 
characters who aren’t built for combat feel more useful 
if they can put their skills to work making the battle 
easier before it even starts. Here are some examples. 
Dark Caves: These caves are pitch black without light 
sources available, making fighting nigh impossible 
without Darkvision or Blindsense. Light sources help, 
but they can only perfectly illuminate your surroundings 
for a short distance around you. 
A standard lantern or a small or medium sized Pokémon 
with the Glow Capability creates a Burst 2 of light around 
it where you can see unimpeded. Every meter between 
a character and their target imposes a -2 penalty to 
Accuracy Rolls and Perception Checks regarding that 
target, but squares illuminated by light do not count 
toward this total. So for example, if a Trainer is holding 
a standard lantern, they have no problem making 
Perception Checks and Accuracy Rolls against anything 
up to 2 meters away from them because those all fall 
in illuminated squares, but an Accuracy Roll against 
something 4 meters away would suffer a -4 penalty, -2 
for each unilluminated meter. 
The size and quality of the light source affects the 
usable radius around it. Large Pokémon with Glow and 
powerful artificial light sources generate a Burst 3, Huge 
Pokémon generate a Burst 4, and the Illuminate Ability 
adds 1 to the Burst radius of a light source. 
To make penalties easy to calculate, simply draw a line 
from a character to their target, count the number of 
meter squares the line passes through, subtract any 
illuminated squares the line goes through, and multiply 
that by -2 to calculate the appropriate Perception and 
Accuracy penalty. 
An Arctic Battle: A battle over a frozen lake could pose a 
unique challenge to even experienced Trainers. The thin 
ice makes it dangerous to use any Pokémon of significant 
size – anything with a Weight Class of 5 or higher breaks 
the ice and falls into the lake. Groundsource attacks and 
other Moves at the GM’s discretion also make holes in 
the ice in their area of effect. 
You could make the ice slow terrain as well to represent 
how one must move slowly over it, and you could even 
call for Acrobatics checks to prevent being Tripped 
when hit by attacks that cause an Injury. 
And finally, to impose an actual danger to falling in the 
water, you could make everyone in the freezing water 
suffer Hail damage each turn and also impose a Speed 
Combat Stage debuff on anyone who falls in. 
The Hazard Factory: This abandoned factory still has 
power thanks to the multitude of Electric Type Pokémon 
that make it their home. Many of the other species in the 
factory have even learned to operate the machinery in 
basic ways and often use it to their advantage in battle.

Here, the gadget whiz of the party who otherwise has 
had trouble contributing to battles can thrive. Suppose 
the PCs are looking to recover an important hard drive 
or piece of equipment from deep within the factory, but 
it is surrounded by hostile wild Pokémon. 
Before the battle even begins, the gadget whiz can find 
where the Electric Types live in the factory and sabotage 
the wiring system to prevent them from powering the 
machines the Pokémon use to defend the factory. In 
the midst of battle, she may even operate the machines 
herself, using cranes to pick up and move enemies, 
activating electro-magnets to pin Steel Type opponents 
in place, or shocking enemies with overloaded circuits.
Collateral Damage: Set your encounter indoors or in 
an area with many fragile items or innocent bystanders. 
Players might be more careful to use their powerful 
area of effect attacks if they have to keep collateral 
damage to a minimum. Even single target attacks such 
as Flamethrower can be extremely dangerous to use in 
a wooden shack. Your players will have to plan their 
tactics carefully or make hard decisions about what 
they’re willing to do to win the battle. 
Set Unconventional Victory 
Conditions
Not all battles have to continue until only one side is 
left standing. Unconventional victory conditions can 
allow you to turn easy encounters into tougher affairs or 
pit the PCs against foes they normally couldn’t handle. 
Remember, running away is always an option too. Even 
strong foes may back down if a few of them are beaten.
Perhaps the PCs are faced with a group of very high 
Level Pokémon they cannot hope to defeat, but all they 
have to manage is to get to a boat waiting for them at the 
beach so they can make their escape. Moves that deal 
a lot of damage may not be as valuable here compared 
to Moves that can Slow foes, inflict debilitating Status 
Afflictions like Sleep, or otherwise impede their foes, 
such as Barrier. 
On the flip side, defeating a pack of weaker foes 
becomes a much more tense situation when they’re the 
ones trying to escape and throwing every trick they can 
against the PCs to slow them down and buy time. Brute 
force might not be enough when time isn’t on their side.
Other unconventional victory conditions you can use 
are trying to disable a machine that’s being guarded – 
the players will have to choose between focusing their 
attacks on the machine itself and the guards who may 
be too powerful to completely defeat in a straight up 
fight, quietly defeating a set of guards without triggering 
noise sensors or allowing them to trip the alarm system, 
and retrieving an artifact from underwater ruins and 
putting it on their boat while assaulted by unending 
waves of aquatic Pokémon. 
Defy Player Expectations
Using the occasional Type Shift or other variants of a 
Pokémon can take players by surprise and turn their 
battle tactics upside down. Even when a Type Shift is 
obvious, it can throw off expectations enough to make it 
a formidable foe, and some Type Shifts are not obvious 
at all. A Normal/Psychic Claydol may clearly look like 
it’s not a Ground Type, but PCs may not realize its 
Typing until one of them fails to damage it with a Ghost 
Type attack. 
Type Shifts are only the start of the variations you can 
use to give more variety to your encounters. As a bonus, 
not only do these help you make more difficult and 
exciting encounters, but if they’re wild Pokémon, then 
players will likely be more interested in capturing them 
for their uniqueness. 
Alternate Move Effects: Change up how standard 
combat mechanics work. Poison doesn’t always have 
to have the same effect, for example. You may create 
a breed of Poison Type Swampert with a Toxic venom 
that’s designed to immobilize and weaken a foe rather 
than knock them out. Instead of Poison’s normal effect, 
Poisoned targets are Slowed and suffer -1 to a random 
Combat Stage each turn, becoming weaker over time. 
Add in Venom Drench for an even stronger debuffer.

Giant Pokémon: Larger variations of a typically small 
Pokémon are also great for adding unpredictability 
to a fight. Take for example the Shiny Giant Caterpie 
described earlier in this chapter. Few players might 
expect it to know a powerful Move like Megahorn. 
Other great candidates for making giant Pokémon are 
Trapinch, Magikarp, and Ditto. Imagine a giant Ditto 
transforming into a super-sized version of the party’s 
biggest and scariest Pokémon. Aquatic Pokémon and 
Bug Types in general make natural fits for this treatment. 
Give giant Pokémon boosted stats and changes to 
their Move and Ability lists to account for their size. 
Body Slam, Thrash, Earthquake, and Bounce are all 
appropriate Moves, and Abilities such as Thrust and 
Thick Fat could prove a nasty surprise as well. 
Swarm Pokémon: Typically, it isn’t recommended to 
use large numbers of Pokémon in an encounter, for 
two main reasons. First of all, it slows down combat 
tremendously to have many more actions per turn, 
and players can become bored waiting for their turn to 
act. Second of all, the action economy of many weaker 
combatants is incredibly dangerous, and you can very 
easily overestimate what your players can deal with.
If you encounter a swarm of Joltiks, the zoofbat 
encourages you to run for your life, as they 
are the most deadly predators you will ever 
encounter in the vast world of Pokémon. No, really, 
they’ll bind you in webs and eat your face.
Sometimes, however, you have to break a few rules to 
make an interesting encounter. Sometimes it just plain 
makes sense that the PCs will be assaulted by a huge 
swarm of bugs or other small Pokémon. 
For these cases, you can create a Swarm Template that 
lets you abstract large numbers of Pokémon into a single 
entity that roughly emulates how fighting a swarm 
would work. Note that this still results in a rather nasty 
encounter! Save it for special occasions.
First, decide on how big the swarm is in your encounter. 
This may vary from merely being a way to group a 
dozen or so enemies into one to save time and trouble 
to representing a fight against a flood of Zubat swooping 
out of a cave to attack the PCs. You can generalize the 
sizes of swarms into a Swarm Multiplier according to 
the following chart. 
Swarm Multiplier Size of Swarm
1
Less than a dozen Pokémon
2
15-25 Pokémon
3
25-40 Pokémon
4
40-60 Pokémon
5
60+ Pokémon
These numbers may seem high, but, of course, it’s 
assumed that each individual Pokémon is trivially weak 
in this case and is only strong due to their numbers. 
Here are the mechanics for the Swarm Template. 
The Swarm is treated as one entity and should be given 
one stat block for a Pokémon of an appropriate Level. It 
has a number of “Hit Point bars” to its Swarm Multiplier. 
It can’t suffer Injuries, but as it takes damage in battle 
and loses all the Hit Points in a bar, its Swarm Multiplier 
decreases by one each time.
The Swarm acts multiple times each turn in battle – it 
has a number of Swarm Points each turn equal to its 
Swarm Multiplier that it spends on actions. The first 
Standard Action or attack each turn is free for the 
Swarm. It then subtracts 5 from its Initiative and can act 
again on that new value. Even if a Swarm hits Initiative 
0, it can still act, even acting multiple times in a row 
on that Initiative tick. However, these actions have a 
cost according to their Frequency. At-Will actions cost 
1 Swarm Point, EOT costs 2, Scene costs 3, and Daily 
costs 4. Yes, this means an especially large Swarm may 
use Daily Moves multiple times in a battle, making it 
especially dangerous. These costs apply only to Standard 
Actions. For Swift and Free Actions that are limited 
to Scene or Daily frequency, a Swarm can use each a 
number of times a Scene equal to its Swarm Multiplier. 
Otherwise, a Swarm can take At-Will and EOT Swift 
and Free Actions each time it acts, frequency allowing.
When a Swarm fails to be able to act due to a Status 
Affliction such as Sleep, it instead loses 1 Swarm Point 
for that turn. A Swarm always has at least one action 
each turn, no matter the result of its Save Rolls. 
Accuracy Rolls to hit the Swarm gain a bonus equal 
to its Swarm Multiplier, but all single target damage 
is resisted one step further. Area of effect attacks and 
attacks that hit multiple targets are treated as one step 
more super-effective, however.

Building Recurring Rivals and Villains
Team Rocket would’ve been much less memorable in the 
Pokémon anime if Ash had fought off nameless grunts 
around every corner rather than consistently facing 
off against Jessie and James. Rivals are also a staple of 
Pokémon media, and it’s a good idea to establish both 
recurring villains and rivals for your campaign. 
Honestly, this is a much less daunting task than it 
might seem at first because many of the guidelines and 
principles you’d follow for making an interesting PC 
apply equally to writing recurring NPCs! 
Give these important NPCs a theme. This applies both 
on a fluff level and on a level of mechanics and how they 
handle battle strategy and approach the PCs. One villain 
may like to lay ambushes and use sneaky Pokémon while 
another is all about flashiness and honorable duels.
Just as you may wish to focus your characterization 
of the PCs’ Pokémon on one or two per character, do 
the same with the rival or villain’s team, creating a 
recognizable mascot of sorts for them. 
It’s important to stat up rivals and villains in a way 
where they have room to grow alongside the PCs. 
Absolutely don’t stat out an early rival appearance with 
more than one or two Classes, because you’ll want to 
save those Class slots for giving them surprising new 
tricks in future meetings or for growing their characters 
in unexpected directions in reaction to the events of the 
game or how the PCs interact with them. 
On that note, you definitely do want to have them learn 
and change from their interactions with the PCs. A 
villain whose bumbling and reckless full frontal assaults 
keep failing will eventually learn more subtle and 
nuanced ways of attacking the PCs. A rival who sees 
their PC nemesis begin to focus on Fire Types and walk 
down the path of a Type Ace might go out of their way 
to pick up a strong Rock or Water Type Pokémon. 
Keep some things the same, of course, or else you risk 
destroying any sense of identity for these NPCs. Also 
important is allowing PCs to develop counters to these 
NPCs the same way the NPCSs do for them.
Encounter Creation for Unbalanced Parties
In a perfect world, all PC parties would be perfectly 
balanced, well-oiled machines where each component 
plays a crucial but balanced role. That’s rarely the case, 
whether due to honest mistakes, munchkins that aren’t 
properly reined in, or other reasons. 
Your first step to deal with this is to develop a plan 
for restoring game balance. This tends to begin with 
talking to any players of PCs that are vastly outshining 
the others and making your concerns known, possibly 
arranging for tweaks that will tone down the characters 
in question. You may also begin planning ways to give 
weaker characters nifty bonuses for their Pokémon or 
opportunities to capture strong additions to their team 
to restore balance over time. 
In the meantime though, you’ll have to cope with writing 
encounters for an unbalanced party. Don’t worry. It’s 
easier than you think.
The most common mistake a GM makes in this situation 
is to overcompensate and insert many hard counters to 
the powerful PCs or to focus fire down their Pokémon 
immediately in encounters. Don’t do this. 
A more fun and reasonable way to deal with this issue is 
to create compartmentalized encounters, where one foe 
or subset of foes may be acting in a slightly separate area 
from the others and is clearly meant for the stronger 
PC and their Pokémon to take on. For example, if the 
PCs are investigating a criminal laboratory, you might 
have a large threat like a Metagross bursting in from the 
outside of the area for the strong PC to hold off while 
the others delve deeper inside, fighting off more minor 
scientists and their Magnemites and Voltorbs as they 
try to get to the heart of the facility and steal its secrets.
This can be combined with the earlier advice on creating 
non-traditional goals for combat that can enable 
scenarios like having the combat monster PC hold 
off enemies while the others set up a crucial piece of 
equipment. This is especially useful because oftentimes, 
a character built to be very good at combat is less adept 
at many non-combat tasks.
While you don’t want to hard counter strong PCs at 
every corner, using Status Afflictions and some selected 
counters to their strategies, especially if villains have 
learned them over time, can help even the playing field.

Teamwork in Battles
The Pokémon video games usually focus on single 
battles, but that will typically not be the case for a 
tabletop campaign! A number of Moves and Abilities 
in the video games make it easy to create teams that 
have a lot of synergy for double and triple battles, and 
Pokémon Tabletop United takes this idea and expands 
upon it. 
Your encounters will be more interesting if you play 
with these parts and show off cool interactions and 
teamwork between your enemies instead of having 
them all function as individual units. GMs, show 
your players this section too! They’ll probably have a 
lot of fun coming up with teamwork tactics amongst 
themselves, and it will make battles more exciting for 
everyone. 
First of all, consider which Trainer Classes contribute 
well to working as a team. In League Battles, the 
Cheerleader and Mastermind are obvious choices, both 
able to use Orders that affect a large number of allies 
at once, or even just their partners in double and triple 
battles. In the tradition of Bards in tabletop RPGs, the 
Musician is also capable of providing support to multiple 
allies with Bardic Flair, War Song, and Lively Beat. 
In full contact fights, the Channeler, Dancer, and 
Hunter are all good at supporting other allies as well. 
Every Channeled Pokémon can benefit from a variety 
of buffs depending on other Channeled Pokémon such 
as gaining Combat Stages when they do or resisting 
attacks that other Channeled Pokémon resist. The 
Dancer provides Combat Stage buffs to its allies. And 
finally, the Hunter takes advantage of positioning and 
ganging up on single foes. 
These are only the most obvious examples, and most 
Classes have some way of helping out their allies if you 
look for them.  
Next, consider Abilities. The most obvious choice for 
Abilities that help allies are Helper, Teamwork, Pack 
Hunt, Friend Guard, Bodyguard, Sequence, and the Veil 
and Boost Abilities (Flower Veil, Ignition Boost, etc). A 
number of Abilities also let Pokémon use their Standard 
Actions to support the team – Interference, Confidence, 
and Rally are just a few. And of course, Plus and Minus 
work together well. When picking Pokémon for a team 
or encounter based on teamwork, look for these.
Many Moves are also designed to support teammates. 
Helping Hand and Blessings are the most obvious 
choices among these. A number of Moves can heal allies 
of Status Afflictions or restore their Hit Points – Soft-
Boiled, Wish, Heal Pulse, Heal Bell, Aromatherapy. The 
Pledge Moves, Echoed Voice, and Round also are at 
their most powerful when used together by a number 
of allies. 
Rototiller, Magnetic Flux, and similar Moves provide 
buffs to allies in a more situational manner. Weather 
effects can also be useful to allies by boosting Move 
damage or ensuring normally inconsistent Moves such 
as Hurricane always hit; weather can easily be the basis 
of a themed team. 
Psych Up is often used for copying an opponent’s 
Combat Stages, but it can also be used for a team to 
copy one self-buffing ally’s Combat Stages.
You can also look for places in the system where you 
can find synergy that isn’t quite as obvious. 
For example, when looking at Plusle and Minun, what 
stands out the most from a teamwork perspective are 
their Plus and Minus Abilities, as well as Sequence. To 
make that combination even more potent, however, a 
Plusle or Minun with an Electric Type Hidden Power 
can power up the other through the Lightning Rod 
Ability. A similar tactic can be used with any area of 
effect Moves of a particular Type and similar Abilities, 
such as Storm Drain, Flash Fire, or Water Absorb. 
Anger Point can be triggered by an ally’s Frost Breath or 
Storm Throw, and if the ally is built so that attack would 
do minimal damage, this can be an incredibly potent 
way to boost an ally to maximum Attack Combat Stages. 
Finally, there are some basic system mechanics which 
encourage cooperation and working as a team. Flanking 
enemies makes them easier to hit, and clever positioning 
can also make use of the fact that combatants count as 
Rough Terrain to help protect allies. Pokémon who have 
achieved a Loyalty Rank of 6 can attempt to Intercept 
attacks aimed at any of their allies.

Creating Gym Challenges
Gym Challenges should have a special place in any PTU 
GM’s heart. They’re where you can go all out in giving 
an NPC nasty and whacky strategies and throw tough 
challenges at your PCs without worrying that you might 
kill them all off with too difficult an encounter. In Gym 
Challenges and other League matches, death tends not 
to be an issue, and Trainers can always challenge a Gym 
again at a later date if they fail the first time. This doesn’t 
mean you should intentionally create impossible Gyms 
or pay absolutely no heed to balance, but it does mean 
you can relax a little and be more experimental. 
In a standard League-based campaign, Gym Challenges 
are the one main constant when it comes to significant 
encounters. You’ll want to do your best to make sure 
they stay interesting throughout the campaign and 
don’t become stagnant. Here are some tips and things to 
consider when crafting your region’s Gyms.
Theme: A region’s Gym Leaders aren’t just a collection 
of powerful Trainers. Usually, each Gym Leader has 
a specific theme to his or her Gym Challenge. Most 
commonly, this is a specialty in a certain elemental 
Type, but you can certainly deviate from the standard 
and build Gym Leaders around a particular Combat 
Stat, a particular kind of battling style, or other factors. 
Feel free to combine themes as well, such as pairing a 
Type with a Combat Stat for a Gym. 
Unique Mechanics: Gym Leaders should pose a 
special challenge to the PCs, and a straight up bog 
standard League match is anything but in most cases. 
Even adding just a small twist to the standard battling 
procedure can help, such as using an electrified floor in 
an Electric Type Gym. You can go further with this and 
create Gyms built around completely different victory 
conditions, such as Capture the Flag or obstacle courses.
While many Leagues will require that Gyms adhere to 
standard League battling regulations – Pokémon battles 
only with no direct Trainer involvement, it is also 
interesting and exciting to break from that and create 
Gyms that challenge the Trainers directly as well.
Here are some examples of Gyms with a strong theme 
that also works well into the unique mechanics they 
present for the Gym Challenge.
A Dark Type Gym that also themes itself on the Stealth 
Skill. The Gym Challenge isn’t about facing off in open 
field combat, but instead the challengers must work as 
a team to retrieve a number of artifacts from a dark 
labyrinth within a time limit while facing assassination 
style attacks from the Gym Leader’s Pokémon. 
A Gym that themes itself off the Cool Contest Stat. It 
has no particular Type affiliation, but it leans somewhat 
toward Flying and Electric Types due to the number 
of Cool Moves of those Types. The battle arena is 
designed as a series of floating platforms that encourage 
combatants to make cool and risky acrobatic maneuvers 
to move around efficiently. An audience judges the 
combatants’ every Move with Appeal Points much like a 
Contest, and special bonuses are given for high Appeal 
such as healing items and buffs. 
A Gym that replicates the terror and arduousness of 
extreme mountain climbing. Set on the peak of a large 
mountain itself, it takes advantage of the permanent 
Hail conditions of its locale to wear down opponents. 
Most of the Gym Leader’s Pokémon are Ground or Ice 
Type, and she throws in the bite of a Sandstorm into 
the challenge for added difficulty. Pokémon with push 
effects are common, replicating the ever-present danger 
of falling in mountain climbing. 
A Grass and Bug Typed Gym that is designed as an 
obstacle course challenge. Winning is simply a matter of 
getting to the end. However, the path to the finish line is 
littered with traps and Bug and Grass Pokémon that will 
try their best to wear the challengers down with Status 
Afflictions rather than attacking directly.

Running The Game

That’s not all you should think about when making your 
region’s Gyms, however! Ideally, your region’s Gyms 
should fit together in a cohesive whole. 
Part of this is simply working to make sure that while 
each Gym has its special theme, the pattern of themes 
used throughout the region is predictable or at the least 
consistent. For example, the previous four example 
Gyms might seem like they’re all over the place in 
terms of theme, but if you make a pattern where Gyms 
always borrow existing facilities or structures for their 
challenges, it could make sense. 
The Dark Gym borrows an old archaeological dig site 
that’s been fully excavated already, or old mine tunnels 
perhaps. The Cool Gym uses a sports arena, perhaps one 
designed for Pokéathlons. The mountain climbing Gym 
borrows the peak of a ski resort during times of intense 
winter storms. The obstacle course Gym borrows a 
forested path through a wildlife preserve. 
Part of this is considering what the role of a Gym Leader 
is in your region, which was covered earlier in the 
section on Constructing a Pokémon League (page 438). 
You will also want to consider how the Pokémon League 
expects challengers to approach the Gym circuit. 
Do challengers simply need to win once and keep a 
Badge for life? Or is qualification to an annual League 
tournament contingent on winning a number of Badges 
again each year? 
Here are some further assorted thoughts and advice on 
creating Gyms.
Don’t enforce a strict Gym order! This isn’t the video 
games, and you have the flexibility of writing the stats 
for a Gym as you need them rather than setting them 
all in stone at the beginning of the campaign. Naturally, 
Gym Leaders keep Pokémon of a wide range of strength, 
using what’s appropriate for a given challenger based on 
the number of other Badges they already have. 
If you want to give a little more structure to your League, 
one way to do so without forcing a single right order for 
Gym Challenges is to create two or three tiers of Gyms, 
where you need to clear one tier to access to the next 
but Gyms within the same tier can be challenged in 
any order otherwise. You could also let Trainers choose 
from a pool of Gyms. Perhaps there are 12 Gyms, but 
you only need 8 Badges to qualify for the League.
Give Gym Leaders personality! Gym Leaders should 
exist for a reason other than for Gym Challenges. They 
should have a place in the community and are often 
well-known figures. Introducing PCs to a Gym Leader 
before the Gym Challenge, such as helping them defend 
the town from a criminal Team’s attack, can help get 
players more invested in the upcoming challenge.
Don’t be afraid to go all out! Gym Leaders are likely 
to have great resources at their disposal, not to mention 
having many connections who can help them out. Except 
perhaps at the lower tiers of Gym Challenges, there’s no 
reason for your Gym Leaders not to make full use of 
TMs, Breeding bonuses, Tutor Moves, Vitamins, Held 
Items, and other edges and bonuses in battle. Some may 
even use Shiny Pokémon with special characteristics or 
make liberal use of Type Shifted Pokémon. 
Rewards for Gym Challenges
It’s standard in the video games to hand out a TM and 
some money as a reward for besting a Gym Challenge, 
but you may wish to go further with interesting ideas 
and offer players a choice between different rewards 
upon their victory. Here are a few to get you started. 
Custom Moves: Gym Leaders will often have their own 
signature Moves they can give out as TMs. This can be as 
simple as, say, giving the Dark Gym Leader mentioned 
previously a Dark Type Phantom Force, and it can be 
as complicated as the Cool Gym Leader developing a 
physical Electric Typed Move that lets the user bounce 
like a pinball between nearby targets, hitting them all if 
they can find a continuous path bouncing off them. 
Badges as Held Items: Badges can be for more than 
show! The Dark Gym Leader’s Badge may grant a 
Pokémon the Dead Silent Capability or Ambush Ability, 
for example, or the mountain climbing Gym Leader’s 
may grant the Snow Cloak Ability. 
Pokémon Eggs: Eggs can make great rewards as well, 
especially when Gym Leaders use Pokémon with special 
traits. The Cool Gym Leader may offer eggs for Flying/
Electric Typed winged Blitzle.
Trainer Equipment: If Trainers are directly involved 
in the Gym Challenge, it can make sense to give them 
equipment as part of a reward. The Grass and Bug Gym 
may hand out Wallclimber Trainer Feet slot equipment, 
for example.

Sample Gym Challenge
This can be rather a lot to consider at once, so we’re providing you with a sample Pokémon Gym Challenge, based 
on one of the Gym ideas that was described earlier in this section. The entry has details on the Gym Leader and 
their Pokémon as well as some fluff on their role in the community. 
The sample Gym Challenge is the mountain climbing gym, which is actually a fairly traditional Gym Challenge 
despite its theme. The aim is still to knock out all the opponent’s Pokémon, and Trainers can only give orders on 
the sidelines. However, this type of Gym Challenge can be easily modified to accommodate full contact battling, 
and it can be exciting for the players to have their Trainers take part directly in the challenge to try to climb the 
mountain alongside their Pokémon. 
The other Gym concepts aren’t given stats here, but you can easily use them as a basis to create your own unique 
and exciting Gym Challenges. There are enough tools and tips in the rest of the Encounter Creation Guide for you 
to create exciting unconventional Gym Challenges if you so desire.

Orders, Precision Orders, Commander’s Voice, Command 
Versatility]
Background: Nicolette hails from the snowy city of Kale, where a ski resort and other tourist attractions drive the 
local economy. While the snow falls year round, her Gym accepts challenges only during the winter months when 
the ski resort closes its highest peaks due to the strong storms in the area. For the rest of the year, Nicolette helps 
run an orphanage in the city, passing the responsibility entirely to her brother in winter while she runs the Gym. 
She is bubbly, incredibly excitable, and very generous, often bringing the children to learn to ski or taking them 
around the mountain on her snowmobile. She is also known for coordinating the city’s biggest donation drive 
during the holiday season right before her Gym duties begin. The donations go to the orphanage’s children, of 
course, along with the other poor and homeless of the cold city.
If Nicolette needs to be given stats for use outside of her Gym duties, she excels in the Mind Category Skills and 
tends to solve problems through cleverness and ingenuity. Athletics, Survival, Command, and Perception are her 
best Skills, though she also has training in Acrobatics, Charm, Focus, and General Education.

Map Notes: 
Each level of the 
mountain is 3 meters 
apart 
in 
height, 
With 
the 
small 
3rd 
level, 
there’s 
essentially 6 meters 
between the larger 
2nd and 4th levels. 
Using the ladders 
counts as Overland, 
but Pokémon can 
attempt to climb up 
3m of cliff directly 
as a Standard Action 
with an Acrobatics 
or Athletics Check 
with DC 12.
The 
mounds 
of 
snow are deep snow 
and count as Slow 
Terrain. The bushes 
are similar but also 
count 
as 
Rough 
Terrain. The icy river 
cracks when anyone 
of Weight Class 3 or 
higher falls onto it 
or when anyone of 
Weight Class 5 or 6 
steps onto it. Each 
turn spent in frigid 
water lowers a non-
Ice Type’s Speed by 
1 CS at the end of 
their turn. 
The players send out 
their Pokémon near 
the sign post on the 
right 
side, 
while 
Nicolette’s Pokémon 
are spread on the 
left side near the 
bridges. The square 
area next to the tree 
is where Nicolette 
stands, but she isn’t 
part of the battle.

Strategy: Nicolette’s Gym Challenge is appropriate for 
Trainers with Pokémon in their late 20s and early 30s. She 
challenges Trainers in groups rather than individually, 
and she is capable of commanding her entire team each 
turn regardless of the normal number of Pokémon 
turns per round. Each PC Trainer commands only one 
Pokémon at a time, but set up the challenge so that the 
total number of Pokémon the PCs can use throughout 
the battle is about one and a half times the number 
Nicolette uses. Nicolette herself is at least Trainer 
Level 40, though this should only come into play for 
determining AP pool. You may also give her bonus AP 
to make up for the players’ numbers advantage.
Nicolette’s strategy revolves around taking advantage of 
weather effects and using battlefield control to slowly 
wear down her opponents. The mountain on which she 
sets her Gym Challenge is enveloped in a permanent 
Hailstorm, at least for the winter months, and this 
results in a special mechanic for the challenge: Effects 
such as Defog and Cloud Nine only temporarily hold 
the weather’s effects at bay, lasting for only two rounds. 
On top of this, Nicolette uses the Climate Control 
Feature to add a Sandstorm on top of the Hail, adding 
additional damage over time to her Gym Challenge. The 
Extreme Weather Feature ensures that her opponents 
also do less damage with their attacks and hit less often. 
All of Nicolette’s Pokémon have had her special training 
applied, allowing them to treat deep snow and ice as 
Normal Terrain. Additionally, they are well-trained in 
mountain climbing and can run up the cliffs around 
the map as if they had the Wallclimber Capability. 
Remember also to apply Training Features!
The other part of her strategy revolves around 
controlling the battlefield. The map on the previous 
page is designed to facilitate this, containing choke 
points and giving opportunity for Push Moves to send 
opponents down cliffs for falling damage or into the icy 
river to be further slowed. The map is actually fairly flat 
for a mountain, and this was deliberately chosen for the 
sake of making battles run smoother. By all means, feel 
free to make a map that is more steep if you feel that is 
an appropriate challenge. 
A typical battle against Nicolette will see her set up 
Stealth Rock and Barrier Hazards near the bridge 
choke points. Depending on the composition of the 
PCs’ teams, she may or may not open with a Light 
Screen for defense.
 From there, her tactics center around a battle of attrition 
for the most part. Several of Nicolette’s Pokémon have 
the Ice Body Ability, so don’t forget to apply that each 
turn as the Hail rages on. She will use Moves like Icy 
Wind and Sand Tomb to lower Speed Combat Stages 
or slow her enemies directly to keep them struggling 
to reach her other Pokémon while taking damage each 
round. Push Moves such as Whirlwind and Strength 
let her push opponents down cliffs for falling damage 
and to slow down their approach further. Vixen plays a 
small cleric role on her team, curing Status Afflictions 
and restoring Hit Points. Nicolette will often have her 
Pokémon retreat up the mountain, forcing opponents to 
take more damage as they try to follow. Haze prevents 
them from setting up Combat Stages during this time.
On her turns, Nicolette will use Orders and Stratagems 
such as Focused Training or Capricious Whirl, 
boosting the number of targets she can affect with her 
Commander Features. Command Versatility lets her 
reuse useful Moves, such as using Blitzen’s Smack Down 
more often or gaining more uses of Vixen’s Heal Bell. 
Resilience helps her win the battle of attrition. 
Flying opponents and other opponents with high 
mobility are Nicolette’s greatest weakness, of course. She 
tends to deal with most fliers by hitting them with high 
damage Ice attacks such as Blizzard, which always hits 
during Hail. Failing that, Rudolph and Cupid both have 
Electric Type attacks for dealing with them, and Blitzen 
may use Smack Down to bring them back to earth, 
especially if that lets Comet trap them with Sand Tomb. 
Pokémon with Magic Guard also give her trouble.
It’s recommended that you leave this weakness as part 
of Nicolette’s challenge because it will give the players 
an angle to prepare from. Her vision behind the Gym 
is to test the challengers’ preparedness for extreme 
environmental conditions after all, so her team is built 
to reward exploiting that weakness. That said, if you feel 
the battle may become too easy that way, you can easily 
give her Mold Breaker Pokémon like Excadrill, more 
Pokémon with Smack Down, and swifter hard-hitting 
fliers of her own. You may even create a custom Move 
that is an Ice-Typed Fire Spin to deal with high mobility. 
Rewards: Summit Badge (Pokémon Held Item, grants 
the Snow Cloak Ability), $6000, and a choice of one 
of the following: Amaura Egg (Inheritance Moves: 
Discharge and Haze), Blizzard TM, Overcloak (Held 
Item/Accessory Item: Grants Overcoat Ability).

Boss Encounters
Even in a League-based campaign of Pokémon Tabletop 
United, there are times you need to throw a traditional 
“boss” encounter at the PCs outside of a Gym Challenge 
or tournament match. It can be a fight against a criminal 
Team admin and his experimental superweapon or even 
a face off against a Legendary Pokémon. 
One important bit of advice you should keep in mind 
in these situations is that merely throwing a single high 
level enemy at a group of PCs is not going to provide 
a challenge. A group of 3 or 4 Trainers with average 
Level 20 Pokémon will often make short work of even a 
Level 80 opponent. If you want to make a single foe an 
imposing challenge for a group, you will have to apply 
some special rules to them in the encounter. 
Standard Boss Template
When Do I Use It?
The Boss Template need not be reserved for gargantuan 
plot-arc-concluding encounters. The nature of action 
economy and combat in PTU makes it a good idea to 
use the Boss Template much more frequently, whenever 
you want a particular enemy to shine in battle. While 
you shouldn’t be making enemies which have the full 
number of Hit Point bars and Initiative Counts in 
battle all the time, you can make lieutenants and enemy 
commanders in regular encounters more significant by 
giving them one extra hit point bar and one extra action 
each turn. 
Basic Stats
Begin by statting the enemy for the Boss Template as 
normal. This is done just like a normal enemy, but you 
want to keep in mind several considerations:
»»
HP is even more important. The Boss Enemy’s 
final number of Hit Points will be multiplied across 
several Hit Point bars, so skimping here will have 
a multiplied effect in making the encounter easier 
than it should be when you apply all the changes 
from the template. 
»»
More than other foes, Bosses need access to reliable 
high-frequency Moves. With all of their actions per 
round, stuffing them with Scene and Daily Moves 
will ensure that they run out of steam quickly. 
»»
Players typically expect Bosses to be big damage 
dealers and threats on their own. Of course, you 
don’t have to abide by these expectations, but keep 
in mind that a Boss Enemy will often be the very last 
foe that the players take down in a fight. If you’ve 
built a Boss that’s purely dedicated to support and 
relies on its minions for damage output, then you’re 
going to see a very anticlimactic end to your fight 
compared to if you build a powerful bruiser. 
»»
Especially powerful Boss Pokémon can have some of 
their Combat Stages set above zero as their Default. 
Actions and Initiative
Count up the number of Pokémon turns your players 
typically have each round. Typically, this will be equal 
to the number of players, but frequent use of Focused 
Command may increase this number. Then add the 
number of Trainers who are mostly specialized towards 
Trainer Combat.  Usually, you would only count 
someone who has built their character to be dedicated 
to spending their Standard Actions using Moves and 
other attacks.
This final number is the baseline for how many actions 
per round a fully fledged Boss Enemy should have when 
facing your party. When making minor Bosses, or for 
lieutenants and commanders in more regular fights, you 
can use a fraction of this final value instead. You should 
space out these actions throughout the Initiative order 
to ensure each round is well paced. Start with the Boss 
Enemy’s base Initiative value. Then subtract 5 and add 
an additional turn at that new Initiative Count. Subtract 
5 again and add another additional turn. Repeat this 
process until you’ve distributed all of the Boss Enemy’s 
turns throughout the Initiative order or you reach the 
point where you can’t subtract 5 anymore without going 
below 1. If you still have leftover turns to distribute, 
then start adding 5 from the enemy’s original Initiative. 
On each round, your Boss Enemy acts on each of these 
Initiative Counts. 
Let’s take for example a Boss Enemy with 20 base 
Initiative and 5 turns per round. Start with giving it 
its normal turn at Initiative Count 20. Then distribute 
turns to Initiative Counts 15, 10, and 5. You still have 2 
turns left to distribute, so those go to 25 and 30. 
EOT Frequency Moves also work differently for Boss 
Template enemies. Rather than needing to wait an entire 
round between using those Moves, they can use EOT 
Moves multiple times a round as long as they put a turn 
in between each use. This also applies to the restriction 
on using Scene x2 Moves multiple times in a row.


## Page 488

Running The Game

Hit Points and Injuries
Just as Boss Template enemies have their actions per 
round multiplied, so do they have their number of 
Hit Point bars, making them effectively as powerful as 
several enemies. For each action a Boss Enemy has each 
round, give them one Hit Point bar. 
When taking percentile damage, such as Poison or 
Sandstorm, recovering percentile Hit Points, such 
as Ingrain or Heal Pulse, or using effects that set Hit 
Points to a certain number, such as Pain Split, use only 
the current Hit Point bar; these effects do not touch the 
other ones. You might notice this looks very similar to 
the Swarm Rules so far. However, do not lower a Boss 
Template enemy’s number of actions per turn as it loses 
Hit Point bars. Doing so would make them degrade in 
power too much to be threatening.
Additionally, Boss Template enemies do not follow 
normal Injury rules and instead gain an Injury only 
when: 
»»
They take Massive Damage. This does not give them 
an Injury for Hit Point Markers, just for Massive 
Damage itself.
»»
They lose half of their total Hit Point Bars.
»»
An effect such as Cruelty specifically mandates 
giving them an Injury.
Keep in mind that Injuries a Boss suffers early in 
an encounter will affect its later Hit Point bars. Plan 
accordingly.
Whenever a Boss Enemy loses a Hit Point bar, additional 
damage or loss of Hit Points carries over to the next. The 
Boss is considered Staggered when it loses a Hit Point bar. 
Mechanically, this doesn’t mean anything in the context 
of the system, but for the sake of pacing your encounter 
and giving the players a sense of progress when fighting 
an enemy that has much more health than normal, it 
can be a good idea to have one or more of the following 
effects occur whenever a Boss Enemy is Staggered. Both 
positive and negative effects are included, as there are 
some Boss encounters you may wish to make easier as 
they go on and some more difficult.
»»
They become Vulnerable until the next time they 
are hit by a damaging attack.
»»
Become Flinched and lose their next turn (not a 
whole round).
»»
Increase a Combat Stage by 1.
»»
They regain a use of a Scene Frequency Move. 
»»
They become cured of a single Volatile Affliction.
Additionally, you may wish for special effects to trigger 
when a Boss Template enemy is down to its last Hit Point 
bar. What exactly this is should depend on the Boss 
itself. A feral Wild Pokémon may become Enraged and 
set its default Attack Combat Stages to +6. A skilled and 
disciplined Fighting-Type Pokémon may unlock access 
to a powerful signature attack. A Boss may simply clear 
itself of negative Combat Stages and Status Afflictions. 
Status Afflictions
Status Afflictions must be modified for Boss Template 
enemies. If you were have a Boss lose a Tick of Hit Points 
on every single turn from Poison, for example, it would 
quickly go down without much of a fight. Here are some 
suggestions for how to modify Status Afflictions.
»»
Burn, Poison, Curse, Sandstorm, Hail, and other 
effects that cause a target to lose Hit Points over time 
occur only once at the beginning of each round, 
rather than on each turn. 
»»
Similarly, effects that cause action denial, such 
as Confuse and Paralyze only affect one turn 
each round. When a Move or effect is used which 
causes one of these Status Afflictions, it affects the 
immediate next turn the Boss has and is assigned to 
that Initiative Count until it is cured.
»»
Sleep and Frozen instead become Drowsy and 
Chilled respectively. These are identical effects that 
affect all of a Boss Enemy’s turns each round but 
do not cause them to lose their actions. Instead, 
they cause a Boss to lose half of their Evasion, and 
upon failing a Save Check, they suffer a -10 penalty 
to their next Damage Roll. Otherwise, they may 
recover from these Status Afflictions as normal, 
though taking damage does not automatically cure 
Drowsy as it would cure Sleep. 
»»
Disable can affect only one of a Boss Enemy’s Moves 
at a time, to prevent a party from completely locking 
down their actions.
»»
Boss Enemies cannot lose multiple turns each round 
from Flinch.
Environment and Minions
Even with a boss template applied, a single boss enemy 
should not be the entirety of the encounter. Giving 
minions to supply support or adding extra effects from 
the environment (such as giving a turn for a volcanic 
environment to “act” by spreading Fire Hazards and 
splashing molten lava out of pools at combatants) is still 
a good move to prevent type advantage from completely 
trivializing a boss as well as to allow the players to split 
up instead of all mobbing around one Boss Enemy.

Experience and Rewards
When awarding Experience for a Boss encounter, do not 
divide the Experience from the Boss Enemy itself by the 
number of players. Looking back to the Basic Encounter 
Creation section, the GM there had 180 Levels to build 
an important encounter. A similar boss encounter with 
a single Pokémon may only be Level 60, which would be 
far less Experience despite a similar level of difficulty! 
While rare, there may be times when you have a Boss 
Enemy or other high level encounter be caught by the 
players. First of all, you should make the Boss Enemy 
immune to Poké Balls until it is on its last Hit Point bar, 
but you should make it very clear and obvious when 
that immunity is broken. 
In the case of a successful capture, there’s no shame in 
ratcheting down their Level to be a more reasonable 
catch for the players, rather than trying to deal with 
them having a new Pokémon far above their average 
party level. You can use a variety of in-universe 
explanations to justify this, such as a Pokémon suffering 
grievous Injuries that make it require a long period of 
training and rehabilitation to reach its former strength. 
Many Boss Enemies are also often artificially boosted 
in power, such as a Pokémon corrupted by dark magic 
or twisted science experiments. Defeating them and 
cleansing them of these factors can weaken them and 
make them more on par with a normal Pokémon. 
Obviously, you would never allow a player to use a 
caught Pokémon as if it had the Boss Template, even if 
it had it before as an encounter.

battles are handled there.
Multi-Part Enemies
Another method for making boss encounters involves 
splitting up the boss into multiple parts, each with their 
own Initiative, bar of Hit Points, and often their own set 
of Moves and Abilities as well. 
Think about classic video game bosses such as the 
Dragon Tank in Chrono Trigger with Head, Body, and 
Wheel parts. The tactical choice of which area of the 
enemy to target adds depth to an encounter and can 
make it more exciting. 
In particular, this method is useful for creating giant 
Pokémon as bosses. You may create a giant Hydreigon 
boss encounter where the dragon perches each of its 
three heads over the top edge of a cliff to face the PCs, 
each of those heads armed with different attacks. 
Simply give each part of the Pokémon stats as if they 
were an individual of the whole species. You can make 
modifications to Base Stats here and use different 
Abilities, but that can add complexity to your statting 
process. Do it if you have the time, but it isn’t necessary.
When it comes to Movement and turns, this can be a 
little trickier. Typically, however, if you’re using this 
method for a giant Pokémon, each individual part will 
be big enough to occupy a sizable part of the battlefield 
and have some freedom of movement itself, for example 
a giant Charizard’s claws or the tail of a giant Steelix. 
Sample Boss: Hydreigon
Each of the three heads takes up a 4x1 area, and they can 
stretch to move 7 meters from their starting position. 
Occasionally, the Hydreigon may reposition itself 
entirely to allow itself better access to the battlefield.

Truly Colossal Foes
Sometimes, simply making a multi-part enemy isn’t 
enough for the scale of your encounter. Sometimes, an 
enemy is so large it doesn’t really make sense how you 
would attack them from the ground or with another 
traditional approach. 
In this case, you may turn the entire enemy into a 
“dungeon” or “level”, turning the encounter into a matter 
of climbing all over them and striking at weak spots. 
Think Shadow of the Colossus. Of course, in such a 
challenge, the boss itself isn’t likely to directly attack the 
PCs. More likely, you will want to turn back a few pages 
and take a look at the advice for using the environment
to spice up an encounter. In addition, such colossal 
Pokémon are likely to be ecosystems unto themselves, 
and you would create the encounter much like any 
other, using the Pokémon who would live there.
The big addition comes in adding the vulnerable parts 
of the colossal Pokémon. A colossal Torterra may have 
certain ancient trees on its back that supply it with 
much of its energy and life force. An Avalugg large 
enough to carry a frozen lake on its back may have 
support structures in that lake which can be broken. 
An ancient Regigigas may have been animated from 
inorganic material, and ancient seals adorn its surface 
which must be broken to shut it down. Give each weak 
spot its own set of stats, or just Hit Points. It’s unlikely 
these can attack directly, but you may have the trees on 
the Torterra’s back use Powder moves, for example.
Special Boss Powers  
If you really want to take a boss battle to the next level, 
it can be a good idea to give them special powers in 
battle that further distinguish them from normal foes. 
A powerful boss may have some or all of their default 
Combat Stages set to a higher value, for example. 
Boss creatures may also be enhanced in some way – 
maybe a gigantic Claydol is also encrusted with Unown 
that give it additional mysterious powers, a Nidoking 
could be strapped into a mechanical power frame, or a 
Delphox could be empowered by eldritch magic. This 
could serve as a convenient in-universe explanation 
for additional Hit Point bars and actions – all of these 
enhancements could account for a boss Pokémon’s 
increased durability and offensive capability in combat.
These special boss powers can be as complicated or as 
simple as you want. Here are write-ups based on the 
above examples in ascending complexity.
Mechanical Power Frame: This Pokémon or Trainer’s 
Attack Combat Stages default to +3, and they add the 
following Moves to their Move List: Metal Claw, Iron 
Head, Meteor Mash. 
Eldritch Magic: This Pokémon or Trainer is empowered 
by powerful magic. Their damaging attacks inflict 
Dementia on 16+. Dementia is identical to Confusion 
except with these additional effects: 
»»
The target suffers a -2 penalty to all Save Checks.
»»
On a roll of 1-8, the target also loses a Combat Stage 
in a Stat chosen at random.
»»
If a target affected by Dementia would be afflicted 
with Dementia again, they are instead Cursed. 
Unown Imbuement: This Pokémon or Trainer has one 
to five Clusters of Unown grafted onto their body. Each 
active Cluster of Unown gives them a passive +1 bonus 
to both Accuracy and Evasion. Clusters of Unown can 
also be burned away and deactivated for the rest of the 
Scene to produce the following effects, depending on 
how many Clusters are burned at once: 
»»
One Cluster – Use the Move Hidden Power as a 
Swift Action as either a Physical or Special Attack. 
The user picks Hidden Power’s Type for each use.  
»»
Two Clusters – Add a +5 bonus to the Accuracy 
Roll of one attack as a Swift Action.
»»
Three Clusters – Use the Move Detect as a Free 
Action.

Other Assorted Boss Tips
Even with strong bosses with multiple Hit Point bars 
and actions per turn, it’s usually a good idea to create 
some smaller minions to fight alongside the boss, 
since defeating them gives a concrete measurement of 
progress for the players. 
Injuries are usually applied meaningfully only to the 
PCs. Except in cases where enemies use an inordinate 
amount of healing, the PCs will typically knock out 
their foes before they accrue enough Injuries to make a 
difference. Bosses are one place where you can buck this 
trend and make strategies based on inflicting or taking 
advantage of Injuries more useful. 
One way to do this is to have a boss or other important 
enemy try to escape during an encounter. It’s not realistic 
to have all enemies fight until the last man standing, 
after all. If the PCs manage to track down the villain 
again within a day or so, it’s probable he will still have 
Injuries from their previous encounter, making it easier 
to defeat them. 
Another way to use Injuries is to throw an already 
Injured villain at the PCs. This can weaken a foe that 
might otherwise be too difficult for the PCs to handle, 
and it can make a lot of sense in situations such as when 
a villain emerges from the ancient temple full of traps 
having found the artifact he was searching for. 
Bosses are also a great place to use unconventional 
strategies and combinations that might take your 
players by surprise. Having a series of weaker foes 
launch Guard and Power Split attacks against a party’s 
strongest Pokémon can really put a spanner in the works 
for the players and give them a memorable encounter. 
Trick Room is another rarely seen strategy that can be 
put to good use in a boss encounter if a boss has many 
slow minions in the battle.
It’s a good idea to consider the various different roles 
Pokémon can play in battle and make them work 
together in a boss encounter. A strong multi-action 
boss will usually be a bulky or speedy damage dealer, 
but you can throw a pair of disablers like Spiritomb 
or Whimsicott alongside them or a pair of clerics like 
Blissey or Meganium to support them and act as force 
multipliers. Think about supporting Trainers for boss 
encounters too. They may even act as direct participants 
in battle using combat-oriented Classes.

Common GM Pitfalls
Because we’ve all made mistakes, and we want to help 
you avoid the ones we’ve made! A lot of these will be 
common mistakes that GMs make when just starting 
a campaign, when PCs and their Pokémon tend to be 
weak and limited, but many of these will continue to 
apply throughout a campaign. 
Players Should Invest in HP
This is more of a player-side issue, but a GM should still 
have their finger on the pulse of their game enough to 
identify it when they see it. 
Especially early on when Levels are low, investment in 
HP is very important for Pokémon and Trainers alike. 
If a player is putting very few or no Stat Points into HP, 
you should probably intercede and tell them that they’re 
going to have a rough time early on. 
Later on, when higher Levels automatically provide a 
decent buffer of Hit Points to a Pokémon, it can be safer 
to slack off on HP investment, but it’s almost never a 
good idea to ignore it entirely. 
On the GM side, aside from watching what the players 
do with their stats, another good idea is to watch the 
Base Stat Relations of the Pokémon you hand out for 
capture. Species with HP as their lowest, or close to low-
est, Base Stat are very difficult to raise early on. Choos-
ing Natures carefully can help alleviate this problem, 
as can providing suppressant berries or other means 
of tweaking Base Stats. Alternatively, simply save these 
species for later in the campaign. 
Beware Flying Pokémon
In the video games, Pidgey and its equivalents are 
chump-change encounters. Depending on your players’ 
starter Pokémon, that could remain the case, or they 
could be terrifying demonspawn due to their simple 
ability to fly and launch attacks from range while 
remaining out of reach of melee attacks. 
Of course, it wouldn’t make sense to simply remove 
all Flying Pokémon from your routes or render them 
pacifistic until your players have Pokémon capable of 
dealing with them in a traditional manner, but you can 
make encounters with them less one-sided and boring 
for your players.
First of all, remind your players that they can do more 
than simply use the Moves they have. Improvised attacks 
such as throwing rocks can allow a melee combatant to 
take aim at flyers, for example. Ambushes with Bait can 
catch birds off guard before they take off, and Combat 
Maneuvers like Grappling can keep them on the ground.
Pokémon in the anime and manga often leap and 
perform great feats of acrobatics to fight their flying foes, 
and that’s no different in PTU. Create an environment 
where Pokémon can leap off outcroppings, trees, and 
other geographical features to reach flying foes with 
melee attacks. In a pinch, they may even use their 
Trainers for a boost. A relatively tall Trainer with their 
hands stretched above their heads will be able to boost a 
small Pokémon up 2 meters, often enough to help close 
the distance between them and a low-flying bird.

Be Careful With Homebrew
By all means, we encourage you to make tweaks and 
modifications to our system to best fit your campaign, 
and, in fact, we provide optional rules and ideas for doing 
so throughout this book. However, it’s probably best as 
a new GM to keep your adjustments and modifications 
within manageable limits as you learn the system. 
Particularly, newcomers to the system often have a hard 
time balancing custom Trainer Classes or assessing 
the balance effect of homebrew Classes that others 
have written, not to mention the possibility that some 
homebrew Classes haven’t been updated to match the 
latest official rules. If you’re new to GMing the system, 
it’s recommended that you have players stick to the 
Classes available in the official releases, whether in this 
book or in one of the supplementary books. 
Even if you’re an experienced GM, if you have new 
players, it may be easier to stick to the official Classes 
until everyone is more familiar with the system and less 
likely to get tripped up by homebrew Classes. 
Another place where new GMs often throw a spanner 
into their own works is by creating more complex 
subsystems for the game or increasing the complexity 
of existing systems, such as reintroducing differing base 
capture rates by Pokémon species. 
This kind of added complexity can often slow down the 
game considerably, especially if it requires looking up 
data often! We fully acknowledge that PTU is already 
a rather complex system with many moving parts, and 
this means the more you can keep things simple, the 
better off you’ll usually be.
Use Shinies Judiciously
Many GMs and players find themselves drawn to 
Pokémon tabletop gaming so they can give their 
Pokémon the quirks and personality they couldn’t in 
the handheld games. Those with a creative streak have 
often imagined variations on their favorite Pokémon or 
“fakemon” species they’ve always wanted to see. With 
the existence of Type Shifts and Shiny Pokémon, it can 
be tempting to flood your campaign world with special 
specimens and make even the mundane species such as 
Rattata routinely extraordinary or to give such Pokémon 
extravagent effects that outstrip normal specimens.
Hold yourself back. We’ve seen cases where campaigns 
can devolve into Shiny Pokémon “arms races” where 
players feel the need to reserve spots on their team for 
Shiny Pokémon only and where any normal specimen 
of a species is going to be grossly devalued once a 
Shiny version is inevitably discovered. This is no fun 
for anyone, and it can be especially frustrating to have 
early game captures or even starter Pokémon that have 
become important to a character from an RP perspective 
rendered dull, uninteresting, and weak compared to the 
plethora of Shiny Pokémon that are made available.
While Shiny Pokémon and Type Shifts are useful for 
spicing up a campaign, especially for veterans of the 
handheld games and of PTU, they are, like most good 
things in life, best in moderation. 
Pace Out Item Availability
No, really, be judicious with how available you make 
powerful items, especially early on. There’s little else 
that’s less fun in PTU than having every battle become 
a game of rocket tag, which can easily happen if 
starting Trainers get their hands on an Earthquake or 
Blizzard TM. It may make sense in a modern society 
that just about anything can be ordered online from the 
equivalent of Amazon.com, but you probably want to 
sacrifice a little realism there for the sake of fun. 
More broadly speaking, don’t make every item available 
in every store, regardless of the item’s power.
First of all, it removes a lot of the incentive to visit new 
places and the excitement players feel when browsing 
stores in new towns. Giving different towns different 
selections of Poké Balls, TMs, Held Items, Evolution 
Stones, and other items is an easy way to give them 
flavor, especially if you designate specialties to particular 
towns like putting a lot of Poké Ball vendors in a town 
with a Poké Ball factory. 
Second of all, players who took crafting Features such as 
Ninja’s Arsenal will feel their Features are cheapened if 
their specialty items can be bought just about anywhere. 
If you need a stronger in-universe reason for limitations 
on TMs and other powerful items, it could simply be 
that the Pokémon League regulates their sale and use, 
making the powerful selections off limits to everyone 
without the requisite Gym Badges.

Beware Single ‘Mon Trainers 
The Pokémon video games teach players to diversify 
their teams and not rely on a single Pokémon for 
everything. The same principle applies to Pokémon 
Tabletop United.
Pouring a lot of Experience into a single Pokémon will 
result in a Pokémon that is very powerful in certain 
situations yet absolutely useless in others. It can be 
very difficult for a GM to manage encounter difficulty 
in such a situation. A Pokémon far above the average 
Level of the others in the party would contribute far 
more than the others if left alone, but if it’s taken out, the 
player who had that Pokémon is usually left crippled if 
they haven’t been raising the rest of their team. Neither 
situation produces a fun dynamic. 
It’s for this reason that we recommend putting maximum 
caps on the amount of Experience that can be allocated 
to a single Pokémon after an encounter. Even if a 
player uses only one Pokémon throughout a large boss 
encounter, it’s okay to let them allocate some of their 
Experience to their weaker team members in order to 
catch them up and to spread Experience among their 
team. 
Don’t be afraid to talk to your players either if they’re 
trying to pump up one Pokémon to the exclusion of the 
rest of their team. If most players have Pokémon in the 
Level 15 range, but one has mostly Level 5 Pokémon 
aside from one that they’re attempting to shoot up to 
Level 30 for a third stage evolution, then that’s probably 
an issue that should be addressed. 
Don’t Run For a Crowd 
Pokémon Tabletop United really plays best when you 
have four or fewer players at the table, plus a GM. 
Once you get into the realm of having five, six, or more 
players, then combat starts getting bogged down, and 
overall it can become quite a slow experience. 
Keep Combat Going Briskly
There are a number of pitfalls that can cause combat 
to go slowly. First of all, make sure you and all of the 
players are well acquainted with the rules in the system. 
Taking time in the middle of a turn to look up rules is 
an easy way for combat to slow to a crawl. 
Second of all, ask the players to pay attention to combat 
and decide on their actions while others’ turns are 
happening. That way, they don’t need to spend time 
once it’s their turn to figure out what they want to do 
and can instead announce their actions immediately. 
Third, keep aids such as the Type Effectiveness Chart 
and Damage Charts at hand for quick reference. This 
is especially important if any of your players are new 
to Pokémon or aren’t familiar with new Types and the 
updates to Type Effectiveness from the newest video 
games. 
Finally, when you’re roleplaying online via real time 
text, such as a chatroom or IRC channel, it’s a good idea 
to conduct the dice rolls and other mechanical parts 
of a turn in combat first before doing all the fluff and 
description. That way, everyone can apply damage and 
other effects while the person attacking types up their 
description for their attack.

Optional Rules 
Baby Template
You may wish to roleplay baby Pokémon has having a 
small handicap, due to their newborn status. 
If so, simply subtract 2, 3, or even 4 from each of the 
Pokémon’s Base Stats, lower each of their Skills one 
Rank, and lower their Capabilities by 2. Weight and 
height are lowered accordingly, by up to 50%. 
Pokémon tend to grow quickly; every 5 levels, they gain 
+1 to each of their Base Stats, and they grow in size a 
little. When they have finally regained all of their Base 
Stats, remove the penalties to skills and capabilities.
This template isn’t necessary for Pokémon that are 
already quite weak; a baby Sentret probably doesn’t need 
this applied, for example, and don’t even consider it on 
a Weedle.  If your Trainers somehow gain a baby Pinsir 
or Tauros early on, you may wish to dampen those Stats 
however. 
You can also use this Template to make Legendary 
Pokémon usable by PCs! You could even make it 
permanent or partly permanent, especially on Pokémon 
with a Base Stat Total of over 60 or so.
Ground Attacks + Flying 
Types
Did it ever seem odd to anyone that Mud Bomb or 
Bonemerang can’t hit flying Types? But somehow 
Venomoth and Beedrill are fully susceptible to 
earthquakes?
Here’s a simple Optional Rule that addresses that:
Instead, Flying-Type Pokémon resist Ground-Type 
moves.
However, Moves with the Groundsource keyword 
(Earthquake, Magnitude, Dig, Fissure, Earth Power) 
do not affect Pokémon that are currently Levitating or 
Flying, regardless of Type.
Narrative Frequency
When the game says “Per day”, it generally refers to one 
in-game day.
But if you play a game where there are often in-character 
time-skips in between days represented by sessions, or 
even if you would just like to keep all of those things 
a bit easier to track, you may want to consider putting 
your game on Narrative Frequency.
“Per Day” can instead be interpreted as “Per Session”. 
Depending on how much do in a single session, this 
may really push your PCs to the limit – which can be 
both a good and bad thing.
If you end the session in the middle of an encounter, you 
may also want to establish that the session “refreshes” 
after you finish any encounters that are still unfinished.
Oh, and be mindful of some features or effects – Egg 
hatching for example would take FOREVER under 
narrative structure.  Consider speeding up Egg Hatching 
when running a Narrative-Frequency game.
Limited Combat Stage Moves
With the wide range of options in Pokémon mobility 
such as flight and burrowing, you might run into the 
problem of having combatants retreat far above or below 
the battlefield to repeatedly use Combat Stage boosting 
Moves until they’re maxed out and ready to fight. 
One way to overcome this is to not allow effects that 
only raise Combat Stages, such as Moves like Swords 
Dance or Abilities like Speed Boost, to take effect 
unless a combatant is within 6 meters of a foe. Unless 
they’re engaged in the midst of battle, they can’t pump 
themselves up for the fight as effectively.

## Page 500

Maneuver: Push
Action: Standard
AC: 4
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Athletics Checks. If you win, the target is Pushed 
back 1 Meter directly away from you. If you have Move-
ment remaining this round, you may then Move into 
the newly occupied Space, and Push the target again. 
This continues until you choose to stop, or have no 
Movement remaining for the round. Push may only be 
used against a target whose weight is no heavier than 
your Heavy Lifting rating.
 
Maneuver: Sprint
Action: Standard
Class: Status
Range: Self
Effect: Increase your Movement Speeds by 50% for the 
rest of your turn.
 
Maneuver: Trip
Action: Standard
AC: 6

Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Acrobatics Checks. If you win, the target is knocked 
over and Tripped.
 
Maneuver: Intercept Melee
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: An ally within Movement range is hit by an 
adjacent foe.
Effect: You must make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check, with a DC equal to three times the number of 
meters they have to move to reach the triggering Ally; If 
you succeed, you Push the triggering Ally 1 Meter away 
from you, and Shift to occupy their space, and are hit by 
the triggering attack. On Failure to make the Check, the 
user still Shifts a number of meters equal a third of their 
check result.
Note: If the target that was Intercepted was hit by an 
Area of Effect Move, and the 1 meter push does not 
remove them from the Area of Effect, the Intercept has 
no effect since they are still in the area of the attack – 
it would cause the Interceptor to be hit by the Move 
however.
Maneuver: Intercept Ranged
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: A Ranged X-Target attack passes within your 
Movement Range.
Effect: Select a Square within your Movement Range 
that lies directly between the source of the attack and 
the target of the attack. Make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check; you may Shift a number of Meters equal to half 
the result towards the chosen square. If you succeed, 
you take the attack instead of its intended target. If you 
fail, you still Shift a number of Meters equal to half the 
result.
Special: Pokemon must have a Loyalty of 3 or greater to 
make Intercept Melee and Intercept Range Maneuvers, 
and may only Intercept attacks against their Trainer. At 
Loyalty 6, Pokemon may Intercept for any Ally.
Additional Rules

Calculating Capture Rates
A Pokémon’s Capture Rate depends on its Level, Hit Points, Status Afflictions, Evolutionary Stage, and Rarity. 
First, begin with 100.  Then subtract the Pokémon’s Level x2.  
Next, look at the Pokémon’s current Hit Points. If the Pokémon is above 75% Hit Points, subtract 30 from the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate. If the Pokémon is at 75% Hit Points or lower, subtract 15 from the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate.  If the Pokémon is at 50% or lower, the Capture Rate is unmodified. If the Pokémon is at 25% Hit Points or 
lower, add a total of +15 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  And if the Pokémon is at exactly 1 Hit Point, add a total 
of +30 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Pokémon reduced to 0 Hit Points or less cannot be captured. Poké Balls will 
simply fail to attempt to energize them. 
Next, look at the Pokémon’s Evolutionary Stage.  If the Pokémon has two evolutions remaining, add +10 to the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  If the Pokémon has one evolution remaining, don’t change the Capture Rate. If the 
Pokémon has no evolutions remaining, subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
Next, consider the Pokémon’s Rarity. Shiny Pokémon subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Legendary 
Pokémon subtract 30 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
And last, consider any Status Afflictions and Injuries. Persistent Conditions add +10 to the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate; Injuries and Volatile Conditions add +5. Additionally, Stuck adds +10 to Capture Rate, and Slow adds +5.

What’s Coming Next? 
The last time we wrote something here, it ended up being completely off. So let’s just say we don’t have explicit 
and concrete plans for the near future right now. Contests are still something we need to completely overhaul. Just 
keep in touch with us at our forums at http://forums.Pokemontabletop.com/index/ or visit our IRC channel on the 
Rizon network at #PokemonTabletop to keep up with development, ask us questions, give feedback, etc. 
Also watch the blog at http://pokemontabletop.com/ for posts about pre-made adventures and other exciting 
supplements to the PTU experience.
