Chapter 6:  
Playing the Game
System Fundamentals
You’ve made your character, chosen a starting Pokémon, 
and you’re ready to start playing the game. What now? 
First of all, we’re going to establish a few basic guidelines 
that will help you read PTU’s rules. 
1. When working with decimals in the system, round 
down to the nearest whole number, even if the decimal 
is .5 or higher. 3.9999 would still round down to 3. 
2. Percentages are additive, not multiplicative. For 
example, this means if you gain a 20% boost somewhere 
and a 30% somewhere else, you gain a 50% boost in total 
rather than gaining a 20% boost and then 30% more off 
of that total, which would result in a total 56% boost. 
3. Specific rules trump more general ones. Basically, 
there are a lot of general rules in the system, and then 
there are a lot of specific uses or exceptions to those 
rules within certain parameters. 
Taking Action
Now, it’s time to learn how to have your character act 
in the game. As you play the game, you simply narrate 
your chracter’s actions, and your GM will narrate the 
way the world around them reacts. 
Your character can do most basic actions without a 
problem. However, when there’s a good chance of failure 
with interesting consequences, the dice will come into 
play to decide success or failure. When this happens, 
most actions will be resolved through Skill Checks. 
Don’t roll the dice if the action is trivial or putting 
a chance of failure on it isn’t interesting. If you’re 
roleplaying a scene about simply chatting in a park, 
and you want to climb a tree while talking, then you 
climb the tree! Now if you’re running from a pack of 
Mightyenas and scrambling for a hiding spot, then that 
would be a time to roll for climbing the tree! 
Making a Skill Check is easy. Simply roll a number of 
d6s equal to your Rank in the appropriate Skill and then 
add your modifiers from equipment and other bonuses. 
If you meet or exceed the GM’s set Difficulty Check, or 
DC, for the task, then you succeed. If not, then you fail, 
and the GM narrates the results of your failure. 
Your GM will usually tell you which Skill to roll for 
a Skill Check. For example, you might tell your GM 
you’re searching the room for traces of fur, feather, or 
scales that a Pokémon’s left behind, and your GM would 
tell you to make a Perception Check.

Don’t be afraid to suggest a Skill as you declare your 
action, especially if there’s a bit of nuance to your action. 
For example, if you simply tell your GM you’re trying to 
sneakily tail someone through town, it’s likely you’ll be 
thrown a Stealth Check. This may not fit if your intention 
was not to remain unseen but to blend in with the crowd 
and act like a passerby, which would be a Guile Check. 
Don’t get too crazy with this. Remember that your GM 
has the last word on this, and any disagreements should 
be settled after the game session and not during it. 
Finally, your GM may also decide to impose 
Circumstantial Penalties on your Skill Check. GMs, see 
page 465 for details on setting DCs and using penalties. 
Opposed Checks
Not all Skill Checks are rolled against a static difficulty. 
Much of the time, you will attempt an action that is 
directly opposed by someone else’s, such as sneaking by 
a watchful guard or lying to someone. In that case, both 
you and your opponent make Skill Rolls and compare 
the results. In the above examples, Stealth vs Perception 
and Guile vs Intuition would be tested. Whoever rolls 
higher wins the Opposed Check. On a tie, the defender 
wins. The defender is whoever maintains the status quo, 
so in the examples above, the guard keeping watch and 
the person trying to detect a lie count as the defenders. 
Cooperative Actions
Trainers and Pokémon can and often should cooperate 
on Skill Checks. There are two ways this is done. 
The first way is through Team Skill Checks, which 
are used for activities where multiple participants can 
contribute equally to one task without a primary actor. 
Often, these Skill Checks are too difficult for one person 
or Pokémon to handle alone. A good example of this 
woud be having multiple Trainers and Pokémon hold 
back a boulder about to roll down a hill. 
The GMs set a DC as they would for a normal Skill 
Check, and then multiplies it by the number of people 
they would normally expect to be necessary for the task. 
This becomes the Team DC for the Skill Check. Each 
Trainer or Pokémon participating rolls their Skill, and 
the total sum of all the Skill Checks is compared to the 
Team DC to determine success or failure. In some cases, 
you will need to make adjustments to this process. For 
example, a very large and strong Pokémon with a Power 
Capability much higher than the other participants may 
count their Athletics Check twice when summing up 
the Skill Checks to hold back a boulder. 
The second way cooperative Skill Checks are conducted 
is through Assisted Skill Checks. There is one primary 
actor in the task, and someone else may assist them in 
minor ways. The DC for the Skill Check is set as normal, 
and the primary actor rolls their Skill Check, adding half 
the Skill Rank of their helper as a bonus to the Check. 
The helper must have at least a Novice Rank in the Skill 
being tested to assist in this way. 
Margin of Success
Not all successes (and failures!) are created equal. The 
amount by which you exceed or fail to meet the DC for 
a Skill Check should factor into the outcome of your 
action. If your GM sets a DC 12 Acrobatics check to 
cross a rickety bridge without falling, then a result 
of 12 to 14 on  your Skill Check probably represents 
you barely making it across, nearly falling one or two 
times.  A result of 16 to 18 might represent confidently 
striding across the bridge, and on 20+ you might even 
do cartwheels to the other side. The same applies for 
failure. A result of 11 would represent barely falling off 
near the end of your trek, while a 2 might correspond to 
tripping over the edge as soon as you step on. 
Your GM may decide that succeeding by a large margin 
of success nets you additional gains, though this isn’t 
a guarantee. While succeeding particularly well on a 
Perception Check to find a hidden switch in a wall might 
also reveal signs that someone else has used it recently, it’s 
difficult to succeed more in the rickety bridge example 
above. At most, you succeed while looking cooler, but 
you don’t gain anything more concrete from it. 
In general, succeeding by a margin of at least 4 or 5 is 
probably worth a little extra oomph, if the situation 
allows for it. 
On the other hand, if you fail by a very small margin, 
your GM may decide that rather than fail the task 
entirely, you succeed – but at a cost. You may cross the 
rickety bridge, but a slip near the end causes you to 
drop one of the ancient relics you had just found in the 
Unown ruins on the other side.

How Long Do Actions Take?
In most cases, it’ll be up to your GM to determine how 
long an action takes, and your result on your Skill Check 
may affect that as well. A higher Stealth Check would 
allow you to pick a lock faster or more quickly sneak 
through a guarded facility, for example. 
However, the types of actions listed in Features do 
give rough guidelines. Standard Actions take no more 
than a few seconds to execute. Swift Actions and Free 
Actions are usually even quicker. Extended Actions 
take at least enough time to be impossible in the middle 
of combat, though the specific amount of time is up to 
the GM. A Chronicler putting away a record may only 
take a minute or two, but attempting to repair a Poké 
Ball may take much longer, up to 15 minutes or half an 
hour. 
Many Features also refer to Scenes. Scenes do not have 
a fixed duration but are defined by the narrative. Think 
about how scenes work in television. If you cut to a 
transition, have a time skip, or everyone is leaving the 
location after a dramatic event, it’s probably a change 
in Scene. Battles are often a Scene, though a Scene can 
sometimes contain multiple battles.
Examples of Scene transitions include: when the party 
splits up to do shopping in town or visits a Pokémon 
Center, when wrapping up a wild Pokémon battle and 
speeding through some mundane travel time, when 
finishing up an investigation of a crime scene and 
leaving for another location, and when entering a new 
city after a journey through the wilds. 
Extended Skill Checks
Skill Checks can take place over a longer period of 
time, such as a complex repair job on a car. In this 
case, Extended Skill Checks are used. The DC for the 
task is set as usual and then given a multiplier from 
2 to 5 based on how long and complex the task is. A 
multiplier of 2 represents a simple but tedious task, such 
as carefully harvesting parts of a plant. A multiplier of 
3 or 4 represents more complex and difficult tasks, such 
as repairing broken machines and carefully canvassing 
a large crime scene. A multiplier of 5 is reserved for 
the most complex and elaborate Skill Checks, such 
as disassembling a criminal Team’s experimental 
superweapon. The normal DC multiplied by this 
multiplier creates the Extended DC for the Check. 
Next, the GM decides how long each Skill Check to 
work on this task will take. This may be anything from 
a few minutes per Skill Check to limiting a character 
to rolling once a day to spend their evening downtime 
hours working on a project. It could be even longer for 
more advanced tasks. This is the Time Interval for the 
Extended Skill Check. 
Finally, the GM decides whether this task is one that will 
be eventually completed as long as the time is put in, or 
whether it is possible for a character to hit a wall in their 
progress. In the former case, a character working on this 
Extended Skill Check simply rolls a Skill Check every 
Time Interval and adds together their results until they 
meet the Extended DC. However, in the latter case, they 
must reach the Extended DC within a number of Skill 
Checks equal to half their Rank in the Skill being tested. 
Failing to meet the Extended DC within this number of 
rolls represents reaching the limit of one’s knowledge or 
expertise, such as an engineer realizing the manufacture 
of a weapon is beyond their current understanding no 
matter how long they spend repairing it.
Action Points
Action Points, or AP for short, are a special resource 
used to fuel many special actions through Features. 
Without Action Points, these Features cannot be used.
Trainers have a maximum Action Point pool equal 
to 5, plus 1 more for every 5 Trainer Levels they have 
achieved; a Level 15 Trainer would have a maximum of 
8 Action Points, for example.
Action Points are completely regained at the end of 
each Scene. However, some effects may Bind or Drain 
Action Points. Bound Action Points remain off-limits 
until the effect that Bound them ends, as specified by 
the Feature or effect. If no means of ending the effect is 
specified, then the effect may be ended and AP Unbound 
during your turn as a Free Action. Drained AP becomes 
unavailable for use until after an Extended Rest is taken.
Action Points are best used through Features; it does 
not cost any special action to use Action Points except 
the Action required by the Feature.  In a pinch, any 
Trainer may spend 1 Action Point as a free action before 
making an Accuracy Roll or Skill Check to add +1 to 
the result. This cannot be done more than once per roll. 
This can be used to modify your Pokémon’s Accuracy or 
Skill Checks as well as your own!

Basic Capabilities
Aside from Skill Checks, Capabilities are probably the biggest determiner of how you take basic non-combat 
actions in Pokémon Tabletop United, and even when you or your Pokémon use Skill Checks, you may need to 
consult your Capabilities to determine the limits of your actions. The main Basic Capabilities are Power, which 
measures how much weight you can lift, Throwing Range, which is how far you can throw, High and Long Jump, 
which measure how far you can jump, and Movement Capabilities, which determine your movement speed using 
various methods like running or swimming. 
There are also Special Capabilities which represent the various elemental powers and other special talents 
Pokémon have. These are too numerous for this chapter on basic gameplay and are instead included in their own 
section in Chapter 10: Indices and Reference on page 303. 
Power
Power represents a Pokémon or Trainer’s physical 
strength. The chart below shows how much weight 
a Pokémon or Trainer can bear, depending on their 
power value.

The Chart above shows various weight limits based on 
Power Value. 
Heavy Lifting: A Pokémon or Trainer bearing weight 
within their Heavy Lifting range takes a -2 CS penalty 
to Speed, and a -2 penalty to Evasion and Accuracy, but 
may otherwise move and take actions. Actions may be 
restricted; if you’re carrying a Growlithe in both arms, 
you can’t very well use attacks that depend on your 
hands. 
Staggering: While lifting weight higher than their 
“Heavy Lifting” range and up to their Staggering 
Weight limit, Pokémon or Trainers are able to move 
only 1 Meter per Shift Action, and cannot take Standard 
Actions. While lifting Staggering Weight, a target also 
suffers a -4 CS penalty to Speed, and -4 to Evasion and 
Accuracy. Each round of carrying Staggering Weight 
requires an Athletics Check with a DC of 4. 
Drag Weight: Pokémon and Trainers can push or pull 
objects that are heavier than their Staggering Weight 
Limit but lighter than their Drag Weight Limit at a rate 
of 1 meter per round. Beneficial conditions may greatly 
increase the drag weight limit; wheels on the dragged 
object, for example, can multiply the drag weight limit 
considerably.

Jumping Capabilities
There are two kinds of Jumps – Long Jumps and High Jumps.  Long Jumps measure how far a Pokémon or Trainer 
can Jump, while High Jumps measure how high. Each Pokémon or Trainer has a specific value associated which 
each of these; this value is represented in meters and measures how far they can jump without making a check 
(assuming the jump is not particularly tricky; jumping onto a narrow ledge might require a check even if the 
distance isn’t particularly far).
Pokémon or Trainers may attempt to increase their High or Long Jump value by +1 by making an Acrobatics 
Check with a DC of 16. 
Movement Capabilities
There are many different kinds of Movement 
Capabilities. The most basic Movement Capability is the 
Overland Capability, which measures how fast a Trainer 
or Pokémon can walk or run on a surface.  Movement 
Capabilities don’t generally need to be tested, although 
the Sprint Action may be taken as a Standard Action to 
increase Movement Speed by 50% for a turn. 
Burrow: The Burrow Capability determines how much 
a Pokémon can shift each turn while underground. 
The holes dug are only as large as the Pokémon who 
burrows. If a Pokémon learns the Move Dig and does 
not have the Burrow Capability, they gain Burrow 3. If 
they already have the Burrow Capability, the Burrow 
value is raised 3. A Pokémon or Trainer ending its turn 
underground must spend a Standard Action to remain 
underground. If a Pokémon or Trainer has already spent 
its Standard Action on a round it ends underground, it 
instead forfeits its next Standard Action.
Overland: Overland is a Movement Capability that 
defines how many meters the Pokémon may shift while 
on dry land. Most Pokémon and Trainers will use 
Overland as their primary movement capability.
Sky: The Sky Speed determines how many meters a 
Pokémon may shift in the air. If a Pokémon learns the 
Move Fly and does not have the Sky Capability, they 
gain Sky 4. If they already have the Sky Capability, the 
Sky value is raised by 4.
 
Swim: Swim is a Movement Capability that defines 
how quickly the Pokémon can move underwater. If a 
Pokémon learns the Move Dive and does not have the 
Swim Capability, they gain Swim 3. If they already have 
the Underwater Capability, the Swim value is raised 3. 
Levitate: Levitate is a Movement Capability that defines 
how quickly the Pokémon moves while floating or 
levitating. When using the Levitate Capability, the 
maximum height off the ground the Pokémon can 
achieve is equal to half of their Levitate Capability. If a 
Pokémon gains the Levitate ability and does not have 
the Levitate Capability, they gain Levitate 4. If they 
already have the Levitate Capability, the Levitate value 
is raised 2.
 
Teleporter: Teleporter is a Movement Capability that 
defines how far the Pokémon can travel by teleportation. 
Only one teleport action can be taken during a round 
of combat. The Pokémon must have line of sight to the 
location they wish to teleport to, and they must end each 
teleport action touching a surface (ie it is not possible to 
‘chain’ teleports in order to fly). If a Pokémon also has 
the Sky or Levitate Capability, they may Teleport into 
Sky spaces (only to spaces within their maximum height 
for Levitate). Teleporter cannot be increased by taking 
a Sprint Action. If a Pokémon learns the move Teleport 
and does not have the Teleporter Capability they 
gain Teleporter 4. If they already have the Teleporter 
Capability, the Teleporter value is raised 4.
Throwing Range
Trainers have a Throwing Range that determines how far they can throw Poké Balls and other small items. This 
Capability is equal to 4 plus their Athletics Rank in meters.

Playing With Pokémon
Players typically do not exercise direct control over 
their Trainer’s Pokémon except in combat. Even putting 
mechanics such as Loyalty aside, we find there are more 
interesting roleplaying opportunities to be found when 
the GM controls all Pokémon, and the players simply 
control their Trainer characters. 
Pokémon can make Skill Checks and use Capabilities 
just as Trainers can, and while Pokémon aren’t directly 
controlled by a player, the process is quite similar when 
it comes to taking action. Simply roleplay your Trainer 
asking your Pokémon for help or giving it instructions, 
and then your GM narrates the result, calling for dice 
rolls if necessary. 
While Pokémon should definitely exercise their 
own agency and display their own personality, we 
recommend that Pokémon generally be amenable to a 
Trainer’s instructions, except in the case of low Loyalty 
and perhaps in extremely dangerous situations or when 
it heavily goes against their nature or moral code. 
As you might expect, a number of activities with 
specific developed gameplay mechanics revolve around 
Pokémon. Most of these have already been outlined in 
Chapter 5: Pokémon: Breeding (page 213), Capturing 
Pokémon (page 214), befriending them in the wild 
(page 215), finding Pokémon fossils (page 216), Fishing 
(page 217), and using Pokémon as Mounts (page 218). 
In addition, Chapter 7 covers everything about Combat. 
Outside of the mechanical actions outlined previously, 
we also recommend time be given to simply roleplaying 
with Pokémon and developing their personalities. 
This is one of the biggest advantages playing Pokémon 
as a tabletop RPG has over the video games, after all! 
Pokémon Amie is adorable, but it can’t beat the depth of 
character development you can express in a roleplaying 
game. A GM has plentiful room to develop Pokémon 
into compelling characters in their own right with their 
own desires, goals, and inhibitions.

Tips for Players
Here are a number of miscellaneous tips that we think 
will help new players of Pokémon Tabletop United. 
Choose Favorites! 
Maybe this seems unintuitive, but you should choose 
one or two Pokémon to focus on more in on-screen 
roleplaying opportunities. This doesn’t have to mean 
your character prefers those Pokémon over others. Off-
screen, they could be giving equal attention to their 
whole team, but in a roleplaying game setting, it’s much 
easier for a GM to flesh out the personalities of a small 
handful of Pokémon and give them ample screentime 
than a full six or more per player. 
Use Pokémon You Like!
This isn’t the competitive battling scene, so you don’t 
have to worry about a metagame or Pokémon tiers. Not 
only do the mechanics of Pokémon Tabletop United 
make the differences in stat totals between Pokémon 
much less important compared to the video games, 
but many strategies from the video games simply don’t 
work, or must be adjusted. The fact ubiquitous and 
powerful moves in the video games such as Earthquake, 
Draco Meteor, and Overheat can only be used once a 
Scene in PTU means you’ll often be seeking out other 
staple Moves for your team and not simply relying on a 
narrow set of the “best” Moves.
That aside, your GM is the one creating the challenges 
you’ll face. Unless all of the players seek out hyper-
optimized teams, there’s little reason for a GM to go all 
out with incredibly difficult to deal with strategies for 
every encounter. Both you and the GM will have more 
fun if you play loosely and choose Pokémon you like 
rather than what you think will be the absolute best. 
State Clear Intentions!
If you simply tell your GM you’re walking on to a route 
outside of town without being clear on why, your GM 
may not know if you simply want to move on or if you’re 
looking for a wild Pokémon encounter to add to your 
team. You don’t want to come up short when you’re 
searching for wild Pokémon, and your GM doesn’t want 
to spend time thinking of Pokémon they think you’d 
want on your team when you aren’t looking to catch any.
Be Ready to Accept Losses!
One of the fantastic parts of roleplaying in a Pokémon 
setting is that it’s easy for characters to face both soaring 
triumphs and crushing defeats without the threat of 
permanent loss like death. Unlike in the video games, 
you won’t even automatically lose half your money 
if you lose to a Gym Leader. GMs will naturally feel 
much more comfortable creating challenges that won’t 
guarantee a player victory when it comes to League 
matches because a “party wipe” in that case doesn’t lead 
to death and new characters being rolled or the end of 
a campaign. 
Talk to Your GM!
We don’t take a hard-line stance in the system about a 
lot of things, from general Pokémon behavior to even 
the genre of the game. The tabletop isn’t the video game, 
and you should be careful about the assumptions you 
might unconsciously bring in from your experiences 
with the games. Be sure to talk to your GM about how 
their world works and what you can expect. 
More than likely, it doesn’t make sense to challenge 
everyone you see on the road to a Pokémon battle or 
to catch everything in sight just to leave it in a box 
somewhere. Nor would your Pokémon appreciate 
being treated as just tools or weapons (though if you’re 
playing a Lasher this may be appropriate!). Your GM 
probably has an idea of how the typical Trainer operates 
and the rules and regulations surrounding them. The 
video games leave a lot unsaid about how the world of 
Pokémon works, and you should pay attention to how 
your GM fills in the gaps. 
Additionally, note that many of the guidelines we 
give in this book are meant to be flexible and change 
based on the campaign, such as Pokémon’s social and 
knowledge Skills, the Mountable Capability, and how 
Shiny Pokémon are handled. These aren’t hard and fast 
rules, and you shouldn’t be afraid to discuss with the 
GM how they’ll work in their campaign.
