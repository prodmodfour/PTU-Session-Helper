Chapter 9:  
Gear and Items
Trainer Essentials 
A number of items are absolutely essential to a Trainer’s 
journey though the world of Pokémon. Usually, a Trainer 
given a Pokémon for the first time by a sponsoring 
Professor or the Pokémon League organization will 
be given a small package of gear to begin with. Other 
times, Trainers scrape up the money themselves to buy 
the basics before they begin their adventure. 
Poké Balls
Poké Balls are specialized pieces of technology that 
capture Pokémon by transforming them into an energy 
form and storing them in a shrinkable metal ball. They 
come in many varieties, designed for different situations. 
Some are better suited for capturing particular Types of 
Pokémon while others have special effects upon capture.
Throwing Poké Balls is an AC6 Status Attack, with a 
range equal to the Trainer’s Throwing Range: 4 plus 
their Athletics Rank. Resolve the attack like you would 
any other. If it misses, the Poké Ball lands harmlessly in 
the terrain beyond the target. If it hits, and the Pokémon 
is able to be Captured, you then make a Capture Roll by 
rolling 1d100 and subtracting the Trainer’s Level. The 
Type of Ball will also modify the Capture Roll. Poké 
Balls can recall Pokémon into them from 8 meters away.
Poké Balls cannot ever capture a Pokémon that’s been 
reduced to 0 Hit Points or less. The energizing process 
is too dangerous for seriously injured Pokémon and 
is thus halted by a failsafe built into all Poké Balls and 
Poké Ball parts sold on the market for self-assembly. 
And of course, Poké Balls fail to activate against owned 
Pokémon already registered to a Trainer and Ball!
Pokédex
This hand-held computer with an advanced camera and 
image recognition software is given out to new trainers 
at the start of their journey. As a Standard Action, a 
Trainer can use their Pokédex to identify a Pokémon 
within 10 meters using the Pokédex’s scanner. Doing 
so reveals the average height and weight of the species, 
height and weight of the individual being targeted, 
Moves that the Species learns through Level Up, and 
some brief facts about the species’ typical behavior. 
These machines may also function as mobile phones, 
radios, and hand-held internet browsers, much like 
typical smartphones. Other apps may be installed to 
grant them further uses. They cost $12,000 or more, but 
in most circumstances they should be made available 
for free to starting characters.

Poké Ball Chart
Basic Balls are sold for $250, Great Balls for $400 and Ultra Balls for $800. All Special balls are usually sold for 
$800 as well, though they may not always be available in every shop.
Why are Poké Balls so cheap for pieces of advanced technology, especially compared to other items available in the 
Pokémon Tabletop United handbook? Well, it’s largely because the game is so dependent on their easy accessibility. 
If you need an in-setting reason, Poké Ball production is likely subsidized by the government due to their ubiquity.

GM Tip: A good way to give towns in your campaign a little flavor is to make different kinds of Special Poké Balls 
be available in each. This can be based on what sort of Apricorns grow nearby, or simply due to the location of the 
town; a town next to a large cave system may produce Dusk Balls, while a town by the beach may produce Lure or 
Dive Balls.
You may even want to invent your own custom Poké Balls for your campaign. Think about what kinds of 
customizations would be useful to the locals or visitors. A snowy mountain town may have invented a variation of 
the Net Ball that catches Rock and Ice Type Pokémon more easily, for example.

Bait: Bait is a tasty, strong-smelling morsel of food 
designed to attract Pokémon. It may be used in two 
ways; to lure Pokémon, or to distract Pokémon. Bait can 
be bought for $250.
To lure Pokémon, set the bait on a route. Every 15 
minutes thereafter, roll 1d20 until you roll 15 or higher. 
If you roll 3 times without success, the bait loses its 
potency and fails. If you succeed however, a random 
Pokémon, based on your GM’s discretion will appear. 
The Pokémon attracted with bait should usually be of a 
Level comparable to the party’s Pokémon. Bait is often 
used for Fishing in this way.
To distract Pokémon, throw it at a Wild Pokémon as a 
Standard Action. The target must then make a Focus 
Roll with a DC of 12. If they fail, the Pokémon gives up 
its next Standard Action to eat the food.
Collection Jar: A simple sealable glass jar. Useful when 
collecting Items from Pokémon, such as Honey from 
Pokémon with the Honey Gather Ability, or MooMoo 
Milk from Pokémon with the Milk Collection Ability. 
Available almost everywhere, and cost $100.
First Aid Kit: Required to use the First Aid Expertise 
Feature. By Draining 1 AP, any Trainer can make a 
Medicine Education Check on a target as an Extended 
Action. The target gains Hit Points equal to the result, 
and is cured of Burn, Poison, and Paralysis. Costs $500.
Fishing Lure: Instead of Bait, some trainers may opt 
to use a Fishing Lure when attempting to Fish. Fishing 
Lures work just like Bait, but can be used multiple times. 
If the line snaps or the fish gets away, they may take your 
lure with them, however. Fishing Lures cost $1500.
Saddle: Saddles help Trainers ride Pokémon. They are 
created with a specific Pokémon species in mind, and 
only Pokémon with that body type can wear the saddle. 
A common Saddle type fits Ponyta, Rapidash, Blitzle, 
and Zebstrika, for example.  Saddles grant a +3 bonus to 
all Skill Checks made to mount Pokémon, or to remain 
on the Saddle when hit by an attack. Costs $2000.
Rope: Rope has many different uses, and is thus popular 
gear for explorers, campers, and hikers. Rope can only 
be damaged by Fire-Type attacks, or attacks made with 
sharp objects – knives, swords, sharp teeth, and Moves 
like Scratch, Slash, Leaf Blade, Razor Leaf, etc. The 
Move Cut ignores all Damage Reduction against Rope. 
Rope can be bought in any length of 25 Feet up to 300. 
The listed prices below reflect 25 feet of rope; simply 
multiply the price appropriately for more.
»»
Basic Rope: Basic Fiber Rope. Has a tensile strength 
of 35 kg or 77 lbs. It has 5 Hit Points. Costs $100
»»
Utility Rope: Braided Utility Rope. Has a tensile 
strength of 80 kg or 176 lbs. It has 20 Hit Points and 
10 Damage Reduction.  Costs $200
»»
Sturdy Rope: Sturdy Rope with a tensile strength 
of 225 kg or roughly 500lbs. 30 Hit Points and 20 
Damage Reduction. Costs $400
Sleeping Bag: A standard sleeping bag. Costs $1000 for 
a single, or $1800 for a double.
Tents: Standard outdoor tents. Provide protection from 
the elements of nature. Costs $400 per meter cubed. 
(A small one person tent would be about 1m x 1.5m x 
1.5m, or  2.25 cubic meters– meaning   900 in price. )
Lighter: For creating flames in a hurry. A regular 
convenience store lighter costs $150; a waterproof 
lighter costs $1000. 
Flashlight: For, you know, seeing. In the dark. Yes. 
Costs $200 for a regular Flashlight; + $400 to make it 
Waterproof.
Water Filter: Can ensure that river or pond water is 
clean to drink after being filtered. Costs $500.

Repels: Repels can be sprayed on one’s self in order to 
ward off wilds with a subtle smell that greatly annoys 
Pokémon. It’s best to not make your own Pokémon 
endure the smell while using Repels yourself. Most wild 
Pokémon won’t bother you when you spray Repel on 
yourself, and will make themselves scarce before you 
even approach.
Spraying a wild Pokémon directly with Repel will cause 
that Pokémon, if the Repel can affect Pokémon of that 
level, to immediately shift away from the user as far as 
the Pokémon is able as an Interrupt, forfeiting their next 
Shift Action. Spraying a Pokémon with a Repel is an 
AC6 Status Attack.

Medicines
Potions and other Basic Restorative Items are 
a useful way for Trainers to keep their Pokémon 
in fighting shape without needing to return 
to a Pokémon center every single time they 
run into an angry wild Pokémon. Potions are 
sold in small, one time use spray bottles that 
when sprayed on a Pokémon, sterilize and heal 
wounds.
Potions and other Basic Restoratives can be 
used on Pokémon and Humans alike to repair 
damaged tissue and seal wounds. If the entire 
bottle of Potion isn’t used, it cannot take effect 
on the Pokémon. 
Be careful with “Repulsive” medicines! They 
decrease a Pokémon’s loyalty with repeated use. 
Most of these items are available for sale at 
PokéMarts. They are essential equipment that 
adventuring Trainers need to have access to 
while they are out on the road, far from any 
Pokémon Centers.
X-Items on the other hand are a bit rarer, often 
sold only in specialty shops or large shopping 
centers. Unlike Basic Restorative items, they 
only function on Pokémon – not on Trainers – 
and are used for augmenting Combat Stages in 
battle rather than healing wounds. Their effect 
lasts until the end of an encounter. 
Using Items
Applying Restorative Items, or X Items is a 
Standard Action, which causes the target to 
forfeit their next Standard Action and Shift 
Action, unless the user has the “Medic Training” 
Edge. The target of these items may refuse to 
stay still and be healed; in that case, the item is 
not used, and the target does not forfeit their 
actions.
If you use a Restorative Item on yourself it is a 
Full-Round action, but you do not forfeit any 
further actions.
Some Items may operate under different rules, 
if stated in their description.

Bandages and Poultices
Bandages are important medical supplies for 
traveling Trainers that aren’t quite the same as 
other Restorative Items. 
Bandages are applied as Extended Actions 
on Pokémon or Trainers. Bandages last for 6 
hours; while applied, they double the Natural Healing 
Rate of Pokémon or Trainers, meaning a Pokémon or 
Trainer will heal 1/8th of their Hit Points per half hour. 
Bandages also immediately heal one Injury if they 
remain in place for their full duration. 
If a Pokémon is damaged or loses Hit Points in any way, 
the Bandages immediately stop working.
Bandages can be found in even minor convenience 
stores for $300.  Poultices have the same effect as 
Bandages, but are itchy and irritating to the skin – they 
may lower the loyalty of Pokémon if used too often, 
much like Repulsive medicine. 
Note: Multiple Bandages may be used throughout the 
day to heal injuries, but only 3 Injuries can be removed 
per day through any combination of Items, Features, or 
Natural Healing. 
Bandages are incredibly helpful for extended treks in 
the wilderness where you might accrue multiple injuries 
over days without seeing a Pokémon Center.

other kinds of food

1/16th of their max Hit Points at the beginning of each turn for 
the rest of the encounter. 
$350
Black 
Sludge
Poison-Type Pokémon may consume the Black Sludge as a 
Snack Item; when the Digestion Buff is traded in, they recover 
1/8th of their Max Hit Points at the beginning of each turn for 
the rest of the encounter. 
$500
Snacks may be consumed at any time by a Pokémon or 
Trainer as an Extended Action to grant a Digestion Buff. 
A Pokémon or Trainer may only have one Digestion Buff 
stored at a time unless they have the Gluttony Ability, 
and they made trade in this Buff during battle to 
use the effect of the Snack. Berries are considered 
snacks. 
Some Snacks require a certain condition to be 
met before a Digestion Buff can be traded in. For 
example, Digestion Buffs from Berries cannot be 
traded in unless the user is at 50% Hit Points or 
lower or unless the user is suffering from a Status 
Affliction the Berry’s Digestion Buff can cure. Some 
Berries specify alternate conditions instead, such as 
being dealt a certain kind of damage or being hit by a 
Type of attack.
Candy Bars and Leftovers are the two other most common 
forms of snacks.  Chefs however, are capable of creating 
diverse varieties of Snacks by using ingredients.

Refreshment Items
Pokémon and Trainers alike love to relax and have some food. Refreshments are Items that grant their effects when 
they are consumed as an Extended Action outside of combat. 
While they can’t heal in a pinch like Potions do, 
they are a cheaper alternative for healing while 
outside of battle. A Pokémon or Trainer can 
only consume one refreshment per half hour, 
unless they have the Gluttony Ability. 
Miscellaneous Food
Food under this category is basically only food fluff-wise; they are consumable items that require an Extended 
Action to consume, have varying effects, and do not affect how many Snacks or Refreshments you can eat or drink.
Baby Food: A nutritious food that causes young Pokémon to grow quickly. When consumed, increases Experience 
Gain of Pokémon at level 15 or lower by 20% for the rest of the day.

Apricorns, Berries, and Herbs
Berries and Herbs are a particular kind of snack food item which grow naturally throughout the world. Some 
berries, like Oran Berries, are very common, while others are very rare. Herbs in general tend to be rare in the wild. 
Common Berries are easily found in Pokémon supply stores, grocery stores, and similar. Rare berries and herbs 
may only be found at specialty shops.  
Apricorns, Berries, and Herbs may be grown by a Trainer with the appropriate Features or Edges, assuming they 
have access to enough space to plant their Plants. 
Once planted, it takes two days for a Plant to Mature.  After becoming Mature, a plant’s caretaker should roll the 
plant’s Yield Roll every day. They gain a number of Berries (or Herbs, Apricorns, etc.) equal to the result of the 
Yield Roll; if the result is zero or a negative number, no Berries are received that day.
Yield Rolls may be modified by Soil Quality however. The Yield Rolls above assume a +0 Soil Quality. Portable 
Growers, or exceptionally fertile natural spots have a Soil Quality of +1 instead, which means all Plants growing 
there increase Yield Rolls by +1. And many places have considerably WORSE soil quality (good luck growing 
berries in sand; hint it’s not going to work). 
Mulch may be used to temporarily increase soil Quality; it may be applied to a Plant to increase the Soil Quality 
of a plant by +1 for the following day. This cannot make a Soil Quality go above +2. Mulch costs $200 per unit.

Poké Balls. Finding a smith to make them isn’t always 
easy. It’s usually simpler to buy the Poké Balls in stores.
Herbs
Herbs have varied effects, ranging from acting as 
repulsive restorative items to giving Pokémon unique 
advantages in the middle of battle. Energy Roots and 
Revival Herbs are used as restorative items in battle. 
Mental, Power, and White Herbs are Snack Items. 
Mushrooms are Held Items and consumed as a Shift

Crafting Kits
These items are either required to use certain crafting 
Edges and Features or greatly aid in their use by finding 
raw material items. 
Chemistry Set: Used to create Repels, Potions, and 
other objects. Costs $1000.
Cooking Set: Used by Chefs to create Snacks and 
Refreshments. Costs $1000.
Dowsing Rod: Dowsing Rods have been attuned to 
the energy resonance given off by Shards. They may be 
used while in any route, cave, or outside area and can be 
bought for $2000. They may be activated by spending 
10 minutes searching an area, and may be activated a 
number of times per day equal to half of the trainer’s 
Occult Education Rank. 
After the 10 minutes, roll 1d6 per Occult Education 
Rank. If the area being searched is a beach, cave, desert, 
or any other sandy or rocky area, roll +1d6. If you have 
Skill Stunt (Dowsing), you roll an additional 1d6.
For each die that results in 4 or higher, you find 1 Shard 
of a random color: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, or 
Violet. You may reroll any die that result in 6, gaining 
that shard and potentially more.
Poffin Mixer: A Poffin Mixer can be used by any Trainer 
to create Poffins. You simply insert cooking ingredients 
worth $500, and at least one of the listed berries. You 
create two Poffins that raises the Contest Stat most 
represented by the berries used by +1 Contest Die. Some 
Berries can raise multiple Contest Stats; you choose 
which to raise when using these Berries to make Poffins. 
Cheri, Figy, Razz, Spelon and Belue Berries raise Cool; 
Chesto, Wiki, Bluk, Spelon and Pamtre Berries raise 
Beauty; Pecha, Mago, Nanab, Pamtre, and Watmel 
Berries raise Cute; Rawst, Aguav, Wepear, Watmel, 
and Durin Berries raise Smart; Aspear, Iapapa, Pinap, 
Durin, and Belue Berries raise Tough. Poffins can be 
purchased for $500 in bakeries and Contest halls, and 
Poffin Mixers cost $500 as well.
Poké Ball Tool Box: These tool boxes let those with the 
know-how craft and repair Poké Balls. They cost $500 
and can be found in most Poké Marts.
Portable Grower / Berry Planter: Portable Growers can 
be used to grow berries and herbs. Portable Growers 
protect the plants within them from external weather, 
and never need to be fertilized. Each Grower holds one 
plant. Portable Growers cost $2000.
Shards: Shards are bits of colored energized crystal 
and are used for various crafting purposes. Each color 
is associated with three Types. Red is Fire, Fairy, and 
Psychic; Orange is Normal, Fighting, and Dragon; 
Yellow is Electric, Rock and Steel; Green is Bug, Grass, 
and Ground; Blue is Water, Ice, and Flying; Violet is 
Poison, Dark, and Ghost.

Scrap and Crafting Items
Scrap is a mechanic that allows Trainers with Crafting 
Edges and Features to make better use of them without 
causing other items to be too easily acccessible due to 
the amount of money they have on hand. Put simply 
Scrap is money that can only be used to pay for a certain 
category of Crafting Edge or Feature. 
For example, a Chef taking home leftover ingredients 
from a restaurant at the end of a day might have Scrap 
to pay for $500 of Chef Features. A gadgeteer rooting 
through a junkyard might be able to salvage parts equal 
to $1000 worth of Poké Ball crafting. This lets a GM to 
regularly reward players who rely on Crafting with the 
resources they need to function without tempting play-
ers with extra crash to buy TMs or other luxury items.
Trainers can also disassemble any item they are capa-
ble of crafting to gain Scrap equal to half the cost they 
would pay to create the item. For example, a Fashionista 
can cut up Fancy Clothes for cloth Scraps worth $1250 
for using their other Features. 
Scrap is always tied to a particular item category. Here 
are some suggestions for those categories.
»»
Food: Snack Items, Refreshment Items, Bait Items, 
Baby Food
»»
Medicines: All Basic Restoratives, X-Items, Dire 
Hit, Guard Spec, Vitamins
»»
Repellents: All Repel Items, all Pester Balls

Equipment
Trainers can don equipment to help protect them on their journeys or grant them special effects. They may only 
equip one piece of Equipment per Equipment slot though; the slots are Head, Main Hand, Off-Hand, Body, Feet, 
and Accessory. 
“Held Items” and “Equipment” share many similarities. “Equipment” is usable only by Trainers. Most Held Items 
are usable by Trainers as well; most Held Items are accessory-slot items when used by Trainers, but some may differ 
according to their description. See the next section for details on Held Items.
Equipping an Item or switching one for another takes a Standard Action. Handing another Trainer an item or 
equipment piece is similarly a Standard Action, but this does not equip the item for them, only grants them 
the ability to equip it themselves. Equipping a Held Item onto a Pokémon is a Standard Action that causes the 
Pokémon to forfeit their next turn.

Weapons
Weapons are perhaps the most common type of 
Equipment. Weapons are Main Hand Equipment pieces 
that modify Struggle Attacks. Weapons may also allow 
Trainers to use Moves as long as they have a high enough 
Combat Skill Rank. Weapons come in three quality 
categories, Crude, Simple, and Fine. Crude Weapons 
do not grant Moves but instead only modify Struggle 
Attacks. Simple Weapons grant a single Move that can 
be used if the wielder has Adept Combat or higher, and 
Fine Weapons grant two Moves, one at Adept Combat 
or higher and another at Master Combat or higher. 
Roughly speaking, Crude Weapons are usually more 
everyday items that have been adapted to use as 
weapons, Simple Weapons are “proper” weapons but 
unexceptional, and Fine Weapons are weapons of a 
quality you may expect on law enforcement or anyone 
else wielding a weapon in a professional capacity. 
There are four kinds of Weapons; Large Melee Weapons, 
Small Melee Weapons, Short-Range Weapons, and 
Long-Range Weapons.  If a Weapon is One-Handed, it 
simply takes up the Main Hand slot – if it’s two handed, 
it takes up the Off-Hand Slot as well. When wielding a 
One-Handed Weapon in the Off-Hand slot, Trainers do 
not gain a Master Move from that Weapon and take a -2 
penalty to Accuracy Rolls for all Weapon Attacks made 
with that Weapon.
Large Melee Weapons raise the AC of the Attack by +1, 
and raise the Damage Base by +2. Large Melee Weapons 
are two-handed.
Small Melee Weapons raise the Damage Base by +1. 
These weapons are obviously one-handed!
Foot Weapons: Hey, if someone wants to make Steel-
Toed Boots or similar as Weapons and equip them in 
the Foot Slot … let them go for it. These are Small Melee 
Weapons, but also raise the AC of the attack by +1. 
Short Range Weapons have a Range of 4 meters. Short-
Range weapons are one-handed.
Long Range Weapons raise the AC of the Attack by 
+1, have a range of 12 meters, and raise the Damage 
Base by +1. Long Range Weapons can’t target Pokémon 
or Trainers that are closer than 4 meters from the user. 
Long Range Weapons are two-handed.
Improvised Weapons: If your Trainers make attacks 
with unconventional objects, let them benefit from 
having a weapon, but impose a penalty based on the 
item. Perhaps the item can only attack once and then 
breaks. Perhaps an item is badly balanced, like a thrown 
stone, and takes a -1 penalty to AC.  Or perhaps it’s just 
not very good at dishing out pain; lower the Damage 
Base by -1 or more. Hitting with a Pillow might be a 
DB1 attack no matter how strong you are, for example.
Weapons may also have additional characteristics based 
on what they are, such as a spear granting the Reach 
Capability for attacks made with the weapon or sword 
breakers giving a bonus to Disarm Maneuvers. 
All modifications that a Weapon makes to Struggle 
Attacks also apply to the Moves they grant and to Moves 
granted by Features with the [Weapon] tag. However, 
these Moves can never benefit from STAB. For example, 
a Large Melee Weapon with an AC 2 DB 4 Move would 
cause the wielder to use it as if it had AC 3 and DB 6. 
A Long or Short Range weapon granting a Move would 
use the Move as if it had a range equal to the Weapon’s.
GM Tips: The cost of weapons should be very dependent 
on the region. However, Crude Weapons are universally 
cheap and can be bought for $500 or less, assuming one 
doesn’t simply go into the kitchen and grab a knife there 
or take a crowbar from the tool box. 
Simple Weapons and Fine Weapons are unmistakably 
designed to be used as weapons and nothing more, 
so their prices are more subject to the legality and 
treatment of weapons in your setting. If weapons are 
commonplace and legal, Simple Weapons may be 
as cheap as $2000 and Fine Weapons $4000.  If all 
weapons are very illegal, Simple Weapons may cost 
$5000 and Fine Weapons $10,000 or more. On average, 
they should cost about $3000 for Simple Weapons and 
$6000 for Fine Weapons. 
Another thing to think about is what sort of weapons 
are allowed. Maybe the police is going to show up very 
quickly at the sight of teenagers traveling with swords, 
bows, and spears – definitely Simple or Fine Weapons. 
But what about baseball bats, slingshots, and hockey 
sticks as Crude Weapons? Establishing the framework of 
what constitutes a common ‘weapon’ in your campaign 
is important, and can help set the tone of the campaign.

Weapon Moves
How do you determine what Moves a Simple or Fine 
Weapon grants? Weapons actually have a whole list of 
Moves all to themselves, which are designed for you to 
mix and match to best fit a given weapon’s fluff. Simply 
look through the list and pick Moves that make sense. 
For example, Pierce! would go well on a spear, but Bash! 
would not. 
Weapon Moves are read in the same format as regular 
Moves, though there is a bit of extra notation for them. 
»»
“WR” is short for “Weapon Range” refers to the 
Weapon’s innate range. That is, Melee for Large and 
Small Melee Weapons, 4 meters for Short Range 
Weapons, and 12 meters for Long Range Weapons 
with a restriction that they can’t target anyone closer 
than 4 meters. 
»»
Limitations refer to the kinds of weapons that can 
be granted the Move.  For example, Backswing can 
only be found on Large Melee Weapons.
»»
Weapon Suggestions are simply our suggestions for 
what kinds of weapons the Move makes sense for, in 
case it was confusing or you need a bit of guidance.
Some Features also allow you to use Moves you learn as 
a Trainer “as a Weapon Attack”. What this means is you 
apply the Damage, AC, etc. modifiers from your Weapon 
to the Move, and your Move gains the Weapon’s Range 
instead if it is 1-Target. Line and Ranged Blast Moves 
retain their area-of-effect keyword but use the Weapon’s 
Range. Burst, Cone, and Close Blast Moves remain their 
normal range.

Fishing Rod
Fishing Rods are used to Fish. They are two-handed items. They come in three varieties; Old 
Rods, Good Rods, and Super Rods. Old Rods cost $1000, Good Rods cost $5,000, and Super 
Rods cost $15,000.
Glue 
Cannon
Glue Cannons are exactly what you expect; This two-handed Equipment piece is a hand-held 
cannon that launches globs of glue. Attacking with a Glue Cannon expends a charge, which must 
be purchased. The attack is an AC8 Status Attack. If it hits, the target is Slowed. On a critical hit, 
the target is instead Stuck and Trapped. The Glue Cannon and three charge packets cost $3000, 
and additional charge packets costs $100.
Hand Net
A long net, usually on the end of a long stick, these pieces of two-handed Equipment are usually 
used for bug catching or fishing. As an AC6 Status Attack, you may attempt to net a Small 
Pokémon using this item. If you hit, you manage to scoop up the Pokémon, trapping them. You 
may move with the Pokémon, dragging them with you. Pokémon may still attack from the Hand 
Net using long-range attacks, or try to attack the net itself, potentially breaking it and freeing 
themselves. Capture Rolls against Pokémon in a net receive a -20 bonus. 
Hand Nets with 50 Hit Points cost $100; 100 Hit Points cost $600; and 200 Hit Points cost 
$1500.  Nets aren’t broken until all of their Hit Points are depleted.
Weighted 
Nets
Weighted Nets are foldable nets used for trapping Pokémon. These two-handed nets, when 
Equipped, can be thrown at a target as a Standard Action, as a Status Attack with an AC of 8. 
While a Pokémon is netted, you may pull on the rope attached to the Net to pull the Pokémon 1 
Meter towards you as a Standard Action.
Pokémon hit by a weighted net become Slowed as long as the net remains and cannot use Sky or 
Levitate Speeds except to safely lower themselves back to the ground. A Pokémon may attack the 
Net to attempt to break free. Capture Rolls against Pokémon in a net receive a -20 bonus.
Weighted Nets with 50 Hit Points cost $500; 80 Hit Points cost $850; and 150 Hit Points cost 
$1200. 
Capture 
Styler
A Capture Styler is a Main-Hand specialized piece of equipment used by some certified Pokémon 
Rangers in a region. It emits a string of energy that is used in a similar fashion to a lasso but is too 
weak to physically restrain a target. Instead, the energy has a calming effect on Pokémon. 
Trainers using a Capture Styler may use Survival in place of Charm when raising the Disposition 
of Pokémon. Acquiring a Capture Styler is easy for those who become certified Pokémon Rangers; 
most qualified Rangers receive one as part of the job. They are not for sale to the general public 
and may cost upwards of $7500 on the black market due to their iconic nature – it’s easy to 
assume that someone who has a Capture Styler is a Ranger. 
Light Shield
A Shield is an Off-Hand defensive item held in one hand or braced to an arm. Light Shields 
grant +2 Evasion. They may be readied as a Standard Action to instead grant +4 Evasion and 10 
Damage Reduction until the end of your next turn, but also cause you to become Slowed for that 
duration. If used Two-Handed, light shields can also function as a Small Melee Weapon. Light 
Shields cost around $3000. 
Heavy Shield
A Shield is an Off-Hand defensive item held in one hand or braced to an arm. Heavy Shields 
grnat +2 Evasion and  may be readied as a Standard Action to grant +6 Evasion and 15 Damage 
Reduction until the end of your next turn, but also cause you to become Slowed for that duration. 
If used Two-Handed, shields can also function as a Small Melee Weapon. Heavy Shields cost 
around $4500.

Wonder 
Launcher
This strange and complicated two-handed machine can only be used by those that have an 
Expert-Level Medicine or Technology Education Skill. The wielder can spend 1 AP to activate 
it, and apply an X-Item at a Pokémon within 8 meters. X-Items applied through the Wonder 
Launcher do not cause the target to forfeit any actions. Items combined by a Researcher may be 
used in the Wonder Launcher, and do not cause the target to forfeit any actions even if they are 
also a Restorative. Wonder Launchers cost $10,000 or more.

Effect
Focus
A Focus grants +5 Bonus to a Stat, chosen when crafted. This Bonus is applied AFTER Combat 
Stages. Focuses are often Accessory-Slot Items, but may be crafted as Head-Slot, Hand or Off-
Hand Slot Items as well; a Trainer may only benefit from one Focus at a time, regardless of 
the Equipment Slot. Focuses are not usually found in stores, but may sometimes be found for 
$6000 at your GM’s discretion.
Snag Machine
Snag Machines are extremely illegal machines that allow trainers to steal another Trainer’s 
Pokémon. They come in both large, immovable varieties and smaller portable varieties. The 
Portable Variety is an Accessory-Slot Item. Inserting a Poké Ball into a Large Snag Machine 
turns it into a Snag Ball permanently, but Large Snag Machines may only turn 5 Poké Balls 
into Snag Balls per day.  Inserting a Poké Ball into a Portable Snag Machine, which is a Swift 
Action, turns it into a Snag Ball after one round, but only for that round. Snag Balls have 
the same properties as the Poké Ball type they were before being inserted into the machine, 
but receive a -2 penalty on all Poké Ball attack rolls, and are capable of capturing owned 
Pokémon. Snag Machines cannot be bought in stores, but may sell on the black market for 
prices of $30,000 or more.
Mega Ring
Mega Rings are extraordinarily rare accessories that allow a Trainer’s Pokémon to Mega Evolve 
when used in conjunction with a Mega Stone. They cannot be bought in stores anywhere and 
must usually be earned through a trial of sorts, governed by a Gym Leader or other influential 
Pokémon Trainer. They can take the form of a bracelet, a necklace, or an actual ring. 
GM TIP: Creating Your Own Items
You’re going to want to create your own equipment; don’t be afraid to do so! One way to provide trainers with 
useful and flavorful equipment is to provide gear that gives small bonuses to Skills; ranging from +1 to +4 at the 
maximum. Some Gear may provide these bonuses only in specific circumstances; that kind of gear can afford to 
give higher bonuses, or simply be cheaper.  
Feel free to tailor these items to your PCs or NPCs, and to your setting. A “Pokémon League Cap” could be a great 
item to include to grant +2 to Command Checks in a Standard Pokémon setting; a Pokémon War Setting might be 
better off with a “Officer’s Stripes” or similar. 
When creating Items, assign them to an equipment slot that makes sense; that +2 Intimidate Eyepatch obviously 
goes on the Head Slot, but that +2 Intimidate Studded Leather Jacket could be a Body or Accessory Slot Item. 
Don’t be afraid to experiment with more exotic effects! For example, some equipment items may allow a Trainer 
to use a Move, such as a fancy hat that lets a Trainer use the Move Swagger once a Scene. These items should allow 
Trainers to use Moves at a lower rate than their natural frequency. Be careful that you don’t give out effects that are 
too powerful or that step on the toes of some PC classes! Finally, you can afford to be a little flexible with which 
items go in which equipment slots. While it’d make no sense to wear a Gas Mask and Sunglasses simultaneously, if 
someone wears a Helmet in their Head Slot, you may let them wear Sunglasses as an Accessory Slot Item.

Held Items
During battle, a Pokémon may be given a single “Held Item”.  Berries, Herbs, and Snack Foods are common 
consumable held items that are destroyed when used, but there are many other items crafted especially for battle. 
On the following page is a chart listing various Held Items that grant a specific boon while held as a Static ability. 
They do not need to be activated; simply holding them is enough.  Held Items may be dropped by Pokémon 
on their turn as a Free Action. Many held items can be used by Trainers as well. When this is the case, they’re 
described with the associated equipment slot used by a Trainer. Not all Held Items can be purchased. Some are rare 
and must be found; these Held Items are marked with a -- in place of a price.
Fluffing Held Items: Fluffing Held Items may in some cases be a little awkward. The most convenient explanation 
is to simply view them as amulets to be worn on a cord around the Pokémon’s neck or on a collar. Or perhaps a 
nice hat; everyone loves hats. Some Items like Stat Boosters may be fluffed as armor that covers the Pokémon, or 
even weapons that can be attached to the Pokémon’s natural weapons.

Pokémon Toolkits
The following Items help with various tasks related to 
the raising of Pokémon.
Egg Warmer: Egg Warmers are insulated cases that 
carry up to four Pokémon Eggs and protect them from 
harm. They also cause Pokémon to hatch twice as fast; 
each day spent in an Egg Warmer counts as 2 days for 
the purposes of Hatch Rate. Egg Warmers cost $2500.
Groomer’s Kit: Used by Trainers with the Groomer 
Edge to clean their Pokémon. Costs $500.
Reanimation Machine: Can be used to revive Fossils. 
Reanimation Machines also come in a smaller but 
more expensive Portable variety. Prices are up to GM 
discretion, often upwards of $10,000. See the Pokémon 
Fossils section for more details (page 216).
Evolutionary Items
Some Pokémon evolve upon contact with radioactive Elemental Stones, while rarer evolutions take place only 
once a Pokémon becomes bonded to a keepsake of sorts. Here are the relevant Elemental Stones and a list of 
Evolutionary Keepsake. All of these items can be bought for $3000 in major stores.

Vitamins
Vitamins are special nutritional drinks which can permanently improve aspects of your Pokémon. However, you 
may only get use out of up to five Vitamins per Pokémon. After you have used five Vitamins on a Pokémon, any 
Vitamins fed to a Pokémon afterwards will have no effect.

$9800
PP Up
Raise one of the user’s Move’s Frequency one level. Use only one per Pokémon.
$9800
Note: PP Ups work differently than they have in previous versions. 
At-Will Moves cannot have their Frequency increased further. EOT Moves become At-Will. Daily and Scene 
Moves gain an additional use in their Frequency’s unit of time. For example, a Daily Move becomes Daily x2, and 
a Scene x2 Move becomes Scene x3. 
 
The following aren’t Vitamins, strictly speaking, but they are related to Vitamins in some way. 
Heart Scale: This tiny rainbow scale from a Luvdisc is valued by Apothecary Researchers, because it can be used to 
create the Heart Booster vitamin.  Luvdiscs will produce them occasionally; they can be found along sandy beach-
es, and ancient ones can be found in desert, caves, or underground. Heart Scales cannot normally be bought, but 
Heart Boosters are detailed in the vitamins section.
Rare Candy: These very rare treats are created from Shuckles that have held a Berry for a long time. When ingested 
by a Pokémon, the eater gains enough experience to reach its next Level. Pokémon may benefit from up to five Rare 
Candies in their lifetime. Rare Candies can cost $9800 or more.
Stat Suppressants: These medicines have an identical effect to the Suppressant Berries – they lower one of the 
user’s Base Stats by 1 point and only function if the Trainer of the Pokémon wants them to. These cost $500.

TMs and HMs
TMs and HMs, or Technical Machines and Hidden Machines, are objects used to teach Pokémon Moves.
TMs are dispensable, one-time use items. HMs on the other hand can be used once per day. TMs and HMs take 
about an hour to take effect; after this time is up, the Pokémon learns the move associated with the TM or HM. 
Not every Pokémon can learn every TM though; check the Pokémon’s TM List to see if they are capable of learning 
that TM. Furthermore, be aware that only 3 of a Pokémon’s Moves can come from TMs or Tutor Moves. See the 
“Moves” section under Pokémon for more details (page 200). TM Moves cost a Pokémon 1 Tutor Point to learn, 
though if this Move is forgotten and replaced by another TM Move (keeping the total number of TM Moves the 
same or lower than previously), the new Move does not cost an extra Tutor Point.
GM TIP: As to what TMs and HMs actually ARE, well, that’s something every GM needs to decide and establish 
at the beginning of their campaign.
The easiest solution is to make them small compact discs, activated by the TM Case itself. The Pokémon’s Poké 
Ball is then inserted into the TM Case, which then digitally transfers the Move information to the Pokémon. If 
this method is used, know that using TMs on Pokémon without Poké Balls will be impossible. Furthermore, the 
Pokémon being taught the Move is unavailable for the hour it takes to fully learn the Move. 
Another solution is to make them Syringes that need to be injected into a Pokémon. If this is the case, consider 
requiring trainers to make a Medicine Education Check with a DC of 8 or so to apply Syringes; you don’t want to 
inject the TM liquid in the wrong place, after all! You should decide what failure means; is the TM simply wasted? 
Or is the Pokémon injured instead? Both? Before choosing this option, consider the barrier to entry it poses to 
trainers both mechanically and psychologically; most trainers don’t want to drive needles into their own Pokémon, 
after all.
You can use one, both, or neither of the methods above. Feel free to come up with your own solutions about the 
nature of TMs. If your campaign takes place in an alternate setting, consider adjusting TMs accordingly. In one 
“Wild West” Themed setting, TMs were represented as hallucinogenic substances designed to take Pokémon on a 
“spirit quest” to teach them the new Move.

Combat Items
The following are items that are largely consumables 
to be used in combat. That isn’t to say that all of them 
are strictly combat items, but their primary use will be 
during fights. 
Caltrops & Toxic Caltrops: These items let the user 
use the Move Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively, as a 
Standard Action. The item is then consumed. Caltrops 
are not usually sold in stores, but may be found from 
specialty shops for $500.
Dream Mist: Dream Mist may be used as an AC 6 
Melee Status Attack, performed as a Standard Action. 
If it hits, the target falls Asleep. Dream Mist is collected 
from Pokémon with the eponymous Capability using a 
Collection Jar but is also in rare occult shops for $500. 
Magic Flute: Magic Flutes are rare artifacts made only 
by skilled crafters with occult knowledge. They are not 
usually found in stores. When a Flute is crafted, it is 
tied to a particular Status Condition. Once per day, the 
Flute may be played as a Standard Action. All Pokémon 
and Trainers within 20 meters of the Flute are cured of 
that Status. These rare artifacts cannot be found in most 
ordinary stores but may cost upwards of $4000 from an 
appropriate occult vendor.
Cleanse Tags: Cleanse Tags are small strips of paper 
with a prayer or incantation written on them. When 
created, the creator makes an Occult Education Roll; 
this is the Cleanse Tag’s Power Value. 
When glued, taped, or nailed to a surface, they stop 
Pokémon or Trainers within 30 meters of the tag from 
Phasing through that surface, as if it was solid, unless 
they make a Focus Skill Check with a result greater than 
the Tag’s Power Value. On a success, the tag is destroyed; 
on failure, the tag holds, and the encroacher cannot try 
again for at least an hour. 
They may also be stuck onto a weapon or appendage to 
let a Normal or Fighting-Type Attack hit a Ghost-Type 
Pokémon for Regularly-Effective Damage; once damage 
has been dealt, the Cleanse Tag is destroyed.
Those with an Occult Education of Novice or higher can 
also burn a Cleanse Tag as a Standard Action to remove 
the Cursed, Suppressed, or Disabled condition from a 
single target within 5 meters. 
Those with an Occult Education of Expert or higher can 
burn a Cleanse Tags to cause all Pokémon and Trainers 
within 30 meters with the Invisibility and Phasing 
Capabilities to make a Focus Check; those whose 
result does not exceed the Tag’s Power Value lose both 
capabilities for 5 minutes. 
Cleanse Tags are simply made of paper and prayer and 
cannot normally be purchased. However, select occult 
shops may carry them for $500 or more depending on 
the rarity of occult knowledge in the setting.
Tip: Don’t make your players have to purchase paper to 
make these … but also, if your Trainer for some reason 
can’t access his belongings at all, they may not be able to 
create Cleanse Tags unless they can find a scrap of paper 
and a writing utensil.
Pester Balls: Pester Balls are small balls full of chemicals 
that come in six varieties, each of which inflicts a 
different Status Affliction when they hit a target. The 
Status Afflictions they can cause are: Rage, Confusion, 
Burn, Poison, Paralysis, and Sleep.
After being hit by any Pester Ball, a target becomes 
immune to the effects of further Pester Balls for 1 hour. 
Throwing and hitting with Pester Balls is the same as 
with Poké Balls.
Pester Balls cost $350.
Smoke Ball: When used, a Smoke Ball creates a 3 
meter blast that fills the area with smoke, as if the move 
Smokescreen had been used. Smoke Balls can only be 
found in specialty shops for around $500.
