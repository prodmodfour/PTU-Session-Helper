Chapter 7: 
Combat
Types and Contexts of Combat
There are two major contexts in which combat occurs in 
PTU, and believe it or not, this is actually very important 
to how you treat combat mechanics and the way certain 
parts of combat work.
The first major context is, of course, in League-
sanctioned Pokémon battles or casual battles that 
follow League rules and regulations. In such battles, it 
is usually not kosher for Trainers to directly interfere, 
such as by attacking their opponent’s Pokémon or using 
supernatural powers to influence the tide of battle. See 
page 440 for guidelines on League Legality.
The other major context comprises all other “full 
contact” fights where League rules and regulations 
don’t apply, including encounters with wild Pokémon, 
fights against unscrupulous criminals, and other battles 
in which Trainers would directly participate and even 
be targets of attack. 
Both Initiative and Switching Pokémon work slightly 
differently depending on the type of combat in order 
to reflect the Trainer’s differing role in the conflict. 
Switching Pokémon is slightly more difficult in League 
Battles to prevent Trainers from simply switching all the 
time in an official match to gain advantage, for example. 
Both types of combat are likely to show up in most 
campaign types, and GMs should be careful to warn 
players if one type of combat will be much more 
prevalent than the other. 
For example, in an average Pokémon campaign, the Ace 
Trainers and Commanders will have their chance to 
shine in Gym Challenges and tournaments, but Martial 
Artists will be better able to stand their ground when 
a criminal Team attacks or when wild Pokémon are 
rampaging. However, in a region in which there’s very 
little criminal activity and even the wild Pokémon are 
relatively tame, Trainers specializing in full contact 
fights won’t feel as useful.
In each round of combat, players get to take two turns: 
one for their Trainer, and one for a Pokémon. Even if 
their Trainer is knocked out or incapacitated, they still 
get their Pokémon’s turn and vice versa.

Initiative
Combat in Pokémon Tabletop United takes place in a 
sequence of 10 second rounds where combatants take 
turns acting in order of their Initiative values. In most 
situations, a Pokémon or Trainer’s Initiative is simply 
their Speed Stat, though Items, Features, Moves, and 
other effects may modify this. 
During Tournament matches and other League Battles 
where the Trainer doesn’t participate directly in the 
fighting, all Trainers should take their turns, first, before 
any Pokémon act. In League Battles only, Trainers 
declare their actions in order from lowest to highest 
speed, and then the actions take place and resolve from 
highest to lowest speed. This allows quicker Trainers to 
react to their opponent’s switches and tactics. Following 
that, all Pokémon then act in order from highest to 
lowest speed.
In “full contact” matches, wild encounters, and other 
situations where Trainers are directly involved in the 
fight, all participants simply go in order from highest 
to lowest speed. 
Ties in Initiative should be settled with a d20 roll off. 
Combatants can choose to hold their action until a 
specified lower Initiative value once per round.
Some effects in PTU last for “one full round.” This 
simply means that they last until the same Initiative 
Count next round. 
Action Types
During each round of combat, each participant may take 
one Standard Action, one Shift Action, and one Swift 
Action on their turn in any order. In addition, they may 
take any number of Free Actions, though actions with a 
Trigger can only be activated once per Trigger. 
As an important note, no matter what Action Type is 
listed in this section, generally Trainers do not have to 
spend actions at the very beginning of Combat to draw 
a weapon or send out their first Pokémon for the fight. 
It’s just tedious and doesn’t add anything to the game, 
and in fights against other Trainers it just becomes an 
action tax that both sides have to pay. The exception, 
of course, is ambushes and otherwise getting caught off 
guard.
Standard Actions: Moves and many Features require a 
Standard Action during your turn to activate and use. 
Examples of what you can do with a Standard Action:
»»
Using a Move
»»
Using a Struggle Attack
»»
Retrieving and using an Item from a backpack or 
similar on a target
»»
Throwing a Poké Ball to Capture a wild Pokémon
»»
Drawing a Weapon, or switching from one Weapon 
to another.
»»
Using the Pokédex to identify a Pokémon
»»
You may give up a Standard Action to take another 
Swift Action
»»
You may give up a Standard Action to take another 
Shift Action, but this cannot be used for Movement 
if you have already used your regular Shift Action 
for Movement. However, it may be used to activate 
Features or effects that require a Shift Action.
»»
Use Combat Maneuvers.
Shift Actions: The Shift Action is the most 
straightforward action during a Pokémon or Trainer’s 
turn; it’s simply used for movement most of the time. 
Trainers may hand other Trainers a small item they 
have on hand as part of a Shift Action, as long as the ally 
is adjacent at either the beginning or end of the shift. A 
Trainer can also sacrifice their Shift Action to perform 
certain other actions:
»»
Returning a Pokémon, or sending out a Pokémon
»»
Returning a Fainted Pokémon and sending out a 
replacement Pokémon
Free Actions: Many features can be activated as Free 
Actions. Features with Triggers are often Free Actions. 
You can activate as many Free Actions as you like, or 
when they are triggered.
Swift Action: Trainers have exactly one Swift Action 
a round, and it can only be used on their turn. Many 
Features are Swift Actions.
 
Extended Action: Extended Actions take at least 
a few minutes to complete, depending on the task. 
If unspecified, assume at least a few minutes with 
concentration adequate to the task. Simply, these actions 
cannot be performed in the middle of combat.
Full Action: Some Features are Full Actions. Full Actions 
take both your Standard Action and Shift Action for a 
turn. The Take a Breather (page 245), Coup de Grâce 
(251), and Intercept (242) Actions are all Full Actions.

Priority Actions: If the user has not already acted 
this turn, an action with the Priority keyword may be 
declared to act immediately; the user takes their full 
turn, ignoring initiative. This counts as their turn for 
the round. A priority action may not be declared during 
someone else’s turn; it must be declared between turns. 
Priority also comes in Priority (Limited) and Priority 
(Advanced) varieties. The Priority (Limited) keyword is 
like Priority except the user may not take their full turn; 
they may only take the action that itself has Priority and 
take the rest of their turn on their own Initiative Count. 
For example, Orders are Priority (Limited), meaning the 
user only uses their Standard Action and does not take a 
full turn. Priority (Advanced) actions don’t require that 
the user hasn’t acted that turn; if they have, they simply 
give up their turn on the following round.
Interrupt Actions: Interrupt Moves may be declared 
in the middle of another combatant’s turn to allow the 
user to take an action. They work similarly to Priority 
(Advanced, Limited) effects in that they only allow you 
to take the action that has Interrupt and not a full turn.
Commanding Pokémon
Basically, when a Pokémon’s initiative in combat comes 
up, simply let the player decide what the Pokémon does.
You do not need to announce your Pokémon’s action 
during your Trainer Turn.
Pokémon can do the following with a Standard Action: 
»»
Use a Move or Struggle Attack
»»
Use Combat Maneuvers
»»
Activate an effect that requires a Shift Action. This 
cannot be used for Movement. 
»»
Use Abilities, Capabilities, or make Skill Checks 
requiring Standard Actions 
»»
Recall themselves into a Poké Ball for a Switch
»»
Pick up Held Items
Additionally, Pokémon may drop most Held Items using 
a Shift Action, though this varies. 
Note: The topic of “uncommanded” Pokémon in general 
is a bit tricky. As a GM, you shouldn’t be too strict about 
only “commanding” one Pokémon at a time; it’d be 
ridiculous that a trainer couldn’t go on a walk with all 
of his Pokémon because “only one can shift at a time.” 
The point is to not let Trainers have an unfair advantage 
in battle. Feel free to control “uncommanded” Pokémon 
in any way you choose to achieve this goal and to just 
make sense. 
You may also create special Double or Triple Battle 
League events where can Trainers command two or 
three Pokémon at a time within those events without 
the need for Features such as Focused Command. 
Another place where you may wish to bend the rules 
when it comes to number of Pokémon turns a round 
is how many Pokémon a villain or other NPC can 
command at a time. Remember that the limit is there 
for the sake of balance on the PC side. If your encounter 
balance requires a villain to have multiple Pokémon on 
the field at once, then go for it!

Pokémon Switching
Trainers can, of course, Switch their Pokémon in battle, 
which returns their current active Pokémon into its 
Poké Ball and sends out another Pokémon to take its 
place. This is often done as one action but can also be 
broken up into separate Recall and Release actions. 
A full Pokémon Switch requires a Standard Action and 
can be initiated by either the Trainer or their Pokémon 
on their respective Initiative Counts. A Trainer cannot 
Switch or Recall their Pokémon if their active Pokémon 
is out of range of their Poké Ball’s recall beam – 8 
meters. During a League Battle, Trainers are generally 
considered to always be in Switching range. Trainers 
may Switch out Fainted Pokémon as a Shift Action. 
Whenever a Trainer Switches Pokémon during a League 
Battle they cannot command the Pokémon that was 
Released as part of the Switch for the remainder of the 
Round unless the Switch was forced by a Move such as 
Roar or if they were Recalling and replacing a Fainted 
Pokémon. Interrupts may still be used but consume the 
next Round’s Pokémon turn as usual. 
Recall and Release actions can also be taken individually 
by a Trainer as Shift Actions. Recalling and then 
Releasing by using two Shift Actions in one Round still 
counts as a Switch, even if they are declared as separate 
actions, and you may not do this to Recall and then 
Release the same Pokémon in one round. A Trainer may 
also spend a Standard Action to Recall two Pokémon or 
Release two Pokémon at once. 
If a player has a Pokémon turn available, a Pokémon may 
act during the round it was released. If the Pokémon’s 
Initiative Count has already passed, then this means 
they may act immediately.
For a visual representation, see the flowchart below.

League Battle Example: 
Trainer A sends out a Hoppip, and Trainer B sends out 
a Charmander. 
Hoppip has higher initiative and goes first. Trainer A 
doesn’t like his Hoppip’s chances though, so he tells his 
Hoppip to return, using Hoppip’s Standard Action to 
Switch it out for his Sandshrew. This would forfeit the 
Sandshrew’s turn this round, but this doesn’t come into 
play in this case because the Trainer already Commanded 
his Hoppip to Switch.  Then it’s Charmander’s turn – 
Charmander gets a free hit on the newcomer, hitting 
him with scratch.
Next turn, Trainer A still has all his actions since Hoppip 
was the one who used his actions to make the switch. 
Trainer A does nothing with his turn though – Trainer 
B decides to Switch Charmander before he’s hurt using 
his own Standard Action, and sends out a Slowpoke. 
Sandshrew then goes; he hits Slowpoke with his own 
scratch. Since Trainer B switched out the Pokémon 
himself and Charmander was not fainted, he forfeits his 
next Command and thus Slowpoke does nothing this 
round.
Next round, Sandshrew goes again, and hits the Slowpoke 
once more.  Slowpoke then uses Water Gun, and KO’s 
Sandshrew. Trainer A recalls the Fainted Sandshrew as 
a Shift Action, and sends out Hoppip again as a Free 
Action. Since Sandshrew was fainted, no turn is lost.
Hoppip goes first, and uses Seed Bomb. Slowpoke is 
KO’d. Trainer B technically has a Pokémon turn this 
round, but he can’t use it because Slowpoke was KO’d. 
He simply must wait until the next round, and then 
sends out Charmander.
Initiative passes to the Trainers again, and back to the 
Pokémon.  Hoppip goes first, and uses Worry Seed. 
Charmander goes next, KOing Hoppip for the win.
Full Contact Battle Example: 
Trainer A runs into a wild Raticate and sends out his 
Wartortle to battle it. 
The Initiative order goes the Raticate, the Trainer, and 
then the Wartortle. The Raticate strikes first with a 
Hyper Fang – scoring a Critical Hit that badly damages 
the Wartortle. Trainer A, concerned, uses his Standard 
Action to Switch Pokémon to his Kadabra. Because this 
is not a League Battle, Trainer A retains a Pokémon turn 
to use to on his Kadabra. 
Normally, Kadabra would be faster in the Initiative 
order than the Raticate. Since its Initiative Tick has 
already passed this round, it can act immediately and 
hits the Raticate with a Psybeam. 
The next round begins, and the Kadabra acts first, at 
its proper Initiative Tick this time. It uses a Confusion 
attack on the Raticate, further weakening it. The Raticate 
responds with a Crunch, OHKOing the Kadabra with 
the powerful super-effective attack. 
On Trainer A’s Initiative Tick, he Switches out his 
defeated Kadabra for a Graveler. Because Kadabra was 
Fainted, this is only a Shift Action, and Trainer A still 
has his Standard Action, which he spends throwing a 
Poké Ball at the Raticate. Unfortunately, he misses. 
Raticate goes first and attacks Graveler with a Super 
Fang. Trainer A is next in Initiative this time, but he 
holds his action until after his Graveler acts. Graveler 
uses Rock Throw against the Raticate, nearly knocking 
it out. Finally, Trainer A takes his held action and 
throws a second Poké Ball, this time hitting the mark 
and successfully capturing the Raticate.

Pokémon Tabletop United uses a square combat grid. 
However, it is a simple matter to treat distances and 
movement abstractly if you don’t wish to use a map.   
A combatant’s footprint on a grid is determined by their 
Size. Small and Medium combatants take up a 1x1 meter 
square. Large is 2x2, Huge is 3x3, and Gigantic is 4x4, 
but you may choose to use other shapes for Pokémon 
that have different body shapes such as serpents. As a 
rough guideline, create the new shape to be roughly the 
same number of total squares as the default shape. 
For example, a Steelix (Gigantic) might be 8x2 meters, 
twisting into different shapes as it moves on the map. 
An Aerodactyl (Huge) is probably 2x4 due to its wide 
wingspan. 
Movement is done with Shift Actions in combat. You 
can move a number of squares with a single Shift Action 
equal to the value of your relevant Movement Capability. 
When using multiple different Movement Capabilities 
in one turn, such as using Overland on a beach and then 
Swim in the water, average the Capabilities and use that 
value. For example, if a Pokémon has Overland 7 and 
Swim 5, they can shift a maximum of 6 meters on a turn 
that they use both Capabilities. You may not split up a 
Shift Action. That is, you cannot move a few squares, 
take a Standard Action, and then continue moving. 
Using Jump Capabilities consumes distance from the 
main Capability used to Shift, such as Overland., or can 
be used as a whole Shift Action by itself.
Diagonal movement is simple. The first square you 
move diagonally in a turn counts as 1 meter. The second 
counts as 2 meters. The third counts as 1 meter again. 
And so on and so forth. 
Two combatants are Adjacent to one another if any 
squares they occupy touch each other, even if only the 
corners touch, as with diagonal squares. Cardinally 
Adjacent, however, does not count diagonal squares.
There are two Conditions that affect movement. 
Stuck means you cannot Shift at all, though you may 
still use your Shift Action for other effects such as 
activating Features. Slowed means your movement 
speed is halved. 
Terrain
Not all terrain is created equal. The type of terrain 
you’re moving over will determine which Movement 
Capability you use to Shift as well as having additional 
affects on your Movement. 
Basic Terrain Type affects which Movement Capability 
you use to Shift.
»»
Regular Terrain: Regular Terrain is dirt, short grass, 
cement, smooth rock, indoor building etc. Basically 
anything that’s easy to walk on. Shift as normal on 
regular terrain!
»»
Earth Terrain: Earth Terrain is underground terrain 
that has no existing tunnel that you are trying to 
Shift through. You may only Shift through Earth 
Terrain if you have a Burrow Capability.
»»
Underwater: Underwater Terrain is any water that 
a Pokémon or Trainer can be submerged in. You 
may not move through Underwater Terrain during 
battle if you do not have a Swim Capability.
In addition to the various types of Basic Terrain, there 
are special types of terrain that further modify your 
movement. All of the following types of terrain also 
have a Basic Terrain Type. 
»»
Slow Terrain: Slow Terrain is anywhere with 
enough debris or brush around so that Trainers 
and Pokémon are significantly slowed down. Some 
examples of Slow Terrain are uneven earth, mud, or 
deep snow or water (that’s not deep enough to count 
as ‘underwater’). Even ice may count as Slow Terrain 
due to the need to move carefully and slowly. When 
Shifting through Slow Terrain, Trainers and their 
Pokémon treat every square meter as two square 
meters instead. 
»»
Rough Terrain: Most Rough Terrain is also Slow 
Terrain, but not always. When targeting through 
Rough Terrain, you take a -2 penalty to Accuracy 
Rolls. Spaces occupied by other Trainers or 
Pokémon are considered Rough Terrain. Certain 
types of Rough Terrain may be ignored by certain 
Pokémon, based on their capabilities. Rough terrain 
includes tall grass, shrubs, rocks, or anything else 
that might obscure attacks. Squares occupied by 
enemies always count as Rough Terrain.
»»
Blocking Terrain: Straightforwardly, this is Terrain 
that cannot be Shifted or Targeted through, such as 
walls and other large obstructions.

Flanking
It is difficult to fight when beset upon from all sides by enemies. When a combatant is Flanked by foes, they take 
a -2 penalty to their Evasion. 
A Small or Medium sized Trainer or Pokémon is considered Flanked when at least two foes are adjacent to them 
but not adjacent to each other. For Large Trainers and Pokémon, the requirement is three foes meeting those 
conditions. The requirement increases to four for Huge and five for Gigantic sized combatants.
Foes larger than Medium may occupy multiple squares – in this case, they count as a number of foes for the purposes 
of Flanking equal to the number of squares adjacent to the Flanked target that they’re occupying. However, a single 
combatant cannot Flank by itself, no matter how many adjacent squares they’re occupying; a minimum of two 
combatants is required to Flank someone. 
Here are some visual aids to help demonstrate this concept.
The Hitmonchan has two 
non-adjacent Zangoose  in 
adjacent squares to him. 
He is Flanked. 
The Hitmonchan has two 
Zangoose adjacent to him, 
but they themselves are 
adjacent, so this doesn’t 
count as Flanking.
It takes three foes to Flank this 
Aggron because it is Large. 
However, a Flygon occupying two adjacent 
squares to the Aggron counts as two foes, so 
it can be Flanked by just this Flygon and the 
Zangoose. 
A Lugia can by itself occupy three adjacent 
squares to the Aggron. However, it takes at 
least two different foes to Flank someone, so 
this does not count as Flanking.

Abstracted Combat Distances
If you’d rather not use a map for battles, don’t fret. Abstracting distances is easy if you follow a few guidelines and 
use proper descriptions of the battlefield. 
1. Separate the battlefield into rough zones to help determine movement ranges. For instance, an indoor battle 
separated into a foyer area, a grand staircase at the far end of the foyer, and a hallway on the side. An average 
Overland value might take someone from the staircase to the center of the foyer, but it may take a Sprint Action to 
get from the staircase to the hallway. 
2. Describe and use landmarks in the environment to help determine area of effect (or AOE) for attacks. A 
Discharge might hit “everyone near the fountain in the foyer”, for example, where the fountain was also previously 
used as a reference for where a foe moved towards. Targets that tried to engage the same foe in melee or move as a 
unit are usually fair game to be hit by Bursts, Cones, Blasts, etc. 
3. Make sure everyone agrees to roll with the GM’s rulings. Abstracted distances in combat can quickly become 
a headache if players and GMs begin to argue about whether someone is really in range or if an AOE could hit 
multiple targets. Everyone should make an effort to be clear on how they’re moving on the battlefield so there’s no 
miscommunication, but when a disagreement happens, the GM’s word is final. 
Example: 
An intrepid Trainer and his Galvantula are infiltrating a Team Aqua hideout in a small cove. The GM describes the 
scene. There is a small dock just on the inside of the cove opening where a submarine is being kept. A Team Aqua 
grunt and his Kingler are resting against it. Further into the cove and beyond the submarine, there’s a door leading 
into the hideout facility itself with a Quagsire standing guard next to it. There are two basic zones to this encounter 
now: the area near the submarine and the area near the door, and both have clear landmarks. 
Wanting to rush into the facility, the Trainer asks his GM whether he and his Galvantula can reach the door. The 
GM thinks for a moment and says that it would take a Sprint Action for either the Trainer or his Galvantula to get 
near the door. 
Thinking this isn’t worth the trouble of being faced up with a Ground Type immediately, the Trainer instead opts to 
stand back and remain hidden while he orders his Galvantula to shift closer to the submarine and use Electroweb 
on the grunt and the Kingler. The GM decides this is fair since they were both described as next to the submarine 
and Electroweb is a Ranged Blast 2. Though it’s a strong hit, and Super-Effective on the Kingler to boot, this doesn’t 
knock them out, and the grunt and Kingler both attack the Galvantula in retaliation on their turns. 
The Quagsire, meanwhile, is too far away, the GM decides, and only manages to Sprint into the zone with the 
submarine on its turn. 
On the Galvantula’s next turn, a Discharge attack takes out the Kingler and Paralyzes the grunt, who ends up 
failing his Save Check to act despite Paralysis. 
Without thinking, the Trainer decides he’s going to head up to his Pokémon and start administering a Potion. 
With Medic Training, this doesn’t cost his Galvantula a turn. Unfortunately, the Quagsire is now in range and 
nails both Pokémon and Trainer alike with a Mud Bomb attack. Even with the Potion, this ends up knocking out 
the weakened Galvantula, and the Trainer sends out his Ivysaur instead. On its turn, the Ivysaur easily defeats 
the Quagsire in one blow with a Seed Bomb. With the remaining grunt slowed by Paralysis, the GM decides the 
Trainer and his Pokémon can easily proceed to the door and enter the hideout after this point, leaving the grunt 
jerkily stumbling after them.

Combat Stats
These were covered in the chapter on character creation, 
but let’s do a recap for the sake of combat! 
Trainers and Pokémon have the same six Basic Stats: 
HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, 
and Speed. When the word Stats is used alone in the 
system, it usually refers to these.
Four Derived Combat Stats are derived from these six: 
Hit Points, Physical Evasion, Special Evasion, and Speed 
Evasion.
Basic Stats
HP: The HP Stat directly affects the amount of Hit 
Points a Pokémon or Trainer has.
Attack: The Attack stat is added to the damage roll of 
any Physical Damage dealt.
Defense: The Defense Stat is used to avoid and resist 
Physical attacks. Whenever a Pokémon or Trainer takes 
Physical Damage, they first subtract their Defense 
before subtracting from their Hit Points. 
Additionally, for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer 
has in Defense, they gain +1 Physical Evasion, up to a 
maximum of +6 at 30 Defense.
Special Attack: The Special Attack stat is added to the 
damage roll of any Special Damage dealt.
Special Defense: The Special Defense Stat is used to 
avoid and resist Special attacks. Whenever a Pokémon 
or Trainer takes Special Damage, they first subtract 
their Special Defense before subtracting from their Hit 
Points. 
Additionally, for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer 
has in Special Defense, they gain +1 Special Evasion, 
up to a maximum of +6 at 30 Special Defense.
Speed: The Speed Stat is used to determine turn order 
during combat. 
Additionally for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer 
has in Speed, they gain +1 Speed Evasion, up to a 
maximum of +6 at 30 Speed.
Derived Stats
Hit Points: While your HP Stat influences your Hit 
Points, they are separate numbers. If a Pokémon or 
Trainer has 0 Hit Points or less, they are unable to carry 
out any actions and are unconscious. Hit Points are 
calculated differently for Pokémon and Trainers.
Pokémon Hit Points = Pokémon’s Level + (HP stat x3) + 10
Trainer Hit Points = Trainer’s Level x2 + (HP stat x3) + 10
Accuracy: A Pokémon’s or Trainer’s Accuracy is 
normally 0. However, like Stats, Accuracy can be affected 
by Combat Stages. Instead of a multiplier, Accuracy’s 
Combat Stages apply directly; Accuracy at -2 simply 
modifies all Accuracy Rolls by -2, for example. Like 
Combat Stages, Accuracy also has limits at -6 and +6. 
Any time Combat Stages would be cleared, Accuracy 
Stages are cleared as well. 
Evasion: Trainers and Pokémon have three different 
sets of Evasion. Physical Evasion, Special Evasion, and 
Speed Evasion. Evasion helps Pokémon avoid being hit 
by moves. When being targeted by a move that has an 
Accuracy Check, a Pokémon adds their Evasion score 
to the Move’s Accuracy Check, if they are conscious. 
Physical Evasion can only modify the accuracy rolls 
of Moves that target the Defense Stat; similarly, Special 
Evasion can modify the rolls of attacks that target the 
Special Defense Stat. Speed Evasion may be applied 
to any Move with an accuracy check, but you may 
only add one of your three evasions to any one check. 
Raising your Defense, Special Defense, and Speed 
Combat Stages can give you additional evasion from 
the artificially increased defense score. However, you 
can never gain more than +6 Evasion from Stats.
Besides these base values for evasion, Moves and 
effects can raise or lower Evasion. These extra Changes 
in Evasion apply to all types of Evasion, and stack on 
top. Any time Combat Stages would be cleared, these 
bonuses to Evasion are cleared as well. Much like 
Combat Stages; it has a minimum of -6 and a max of +6. 
Negative Evasion can erase Evasion from other sources, 
but does not increase the Accuracy of an enemy’s Moves.
No matter from which sources you receive Evasion, you 
may only raise a Move’s Accuracy Check by a max of +9.


## Page 235

Combat

Combat Stages
Many Moves alter Stats by raising or lowering 
“Combat Stages”, making them more formidable or less 
threatening respectively. Only Attack, Defense, Special 
Attack, Special Defense, and Speed may have Combat 
Stages. HP and Hit Points never have Combat Stages.
Moves and effects may change Combat Stages any 
number of times, but they may never be raised higher 
than +6 or lower than -6. For every Combat Stage 
above 0, a Stat is raised by 20%, rounded down. For 
every Combat Stage below 0, a Stat is lowered by 10%, 
rounded down.
This means that if a Stat has raised 6 Combat Stages; 
its affected stat should be 220% of its original value. If 
a stat has been lowered 6 Combat Stages, its affected 
stat should be 40% of its original value. Consult the 
chart on the right to see the multiplier for any given 
Combat Stage. To derive the correct value for a given 
Stat, simply multiply the Stat by the multiplier next to 
the corresponding combat stage.
One easy way to apply Combat Stages for Defense, 
Special Defense, and Speed is to simply remember that 
Stat Evasion is also equal to 20% of a Stat. This means 
each positive Combat Stage is equal to the Evasion you 
gain from that Stat, at least until you reach the point 
where you would have more Evasion than the cap. 
Combat Stages remain until the Pokémon or Trainer is 
switched out, or until the end of the encounter.
Speed Combat Stages and Movement
Combat Stages in the Speed Stat are special; they 
affect the movement capabilities of the Trainer or 
Pokémon. Quite simply, you gain a bonus or penalty 
to all Movement Speeds equal to half your current 
Speed Combat Stage value rounded down; if you are at 
Speed CS +6, you gain +3 to all Movement Speeds, for 
example. Being at a negative Combat Stage reduces your 
movement equally, but may never reduce it below 2.

Whenever you attempt to make an attack, you must 
make an Accuracy Roll, and to hit, this roll must meet 
or exceed the Accuracy Check.
An Accuracy Roll is always simply 1d20, but is modified 
by the user’s Accuracy and by certain Moves and other 
effects. Note that modifiers to Accuracy Rolls do not 
affect effects from Moves that occur upon specific dice 
results, or that increase Critical Hit range. For example, 
if you use Flamethrower with an Accuracy Bonus of +4 
and roll a 16 on d20 before adding 4, this would neither 
be a Critical Hit, nor inflict a Burn. 
Note that a roll of 1 is always a miss, even if Accuracy 
modifiers would cause the total roll to hit. Similarly, a 
roll of 20 is always a hit.
An Accuracy Check is the number an Accuracy Roll 
needs to meet or exceed to hit. It’s determined first taking 
the Move’s base AC and adding the target’s Evasion.  
For example, if using Earthquake, which has an Accuracy 
Check of 2, against an opponent with a Physical Evasion 
of +4, you would need to roll a 6 or higher on your 
Accuracy Roll to hit the target. 
A target can willingly choose to be hit by a Move that 
would hit when their Evasion is not applied – the user of 
the Move must still meet the Move’s base AC. 
Dealing Damage
When an attack hits, you apply any effects of the attack 
to the target, including damage. 
When rolling Damage, check the attack’s Damage Base. 
This number serves as a guide for an attack’s strength, 
which translates to a specific amount of damage. Many 
effects, such as Same Type Attack Bonus or STAB for 
short may alter the Damage Base of Moves.
After applying all modifiers that alter Damage Base, 
see the corresponding Actual Damage in the Damage 
Charts on the following page. This is the roll (or number) 
to which you add your Attack or Special Attack Stat.
After you have added your appropriate Attack Stat to 
the Actual Damage of the attack, add any additional 
modifiers that may apply.
The target then subtracts the appropriate Defense Stat. 
Physical Attacks have Defense subtracted from them; 
Special Attacks have Special Defense subtracted from 
them. If the target has Damage Reduction, that is 
subtracted as well. An attack will always do a minimum 
of 1 damage, even if Defense Stats would reduce it to 0.
After defenses and damage reduction have been applied, 
apply Type Weaknesses or Resistances. A Super-
Effective hit will deal x1.5 damage. A Doubly Super-
Effective hit will deal x2 damage. Rare Triply-Effective 
Hits will deal x3 damage. 
A Resisted Hit deals 1/2 damage; a doubly Resisted hit 
deals 1/4th damage. A rare triply-Resisted hit deals 
1/8th damage.
See the Type Effectiveness Chart on page 238 to see 
how Pokémon Types match up against each other.
Same Type Attack Bonus
If a Pokémon uses a damaging Move with which it shares 
a Type, the Damage Base of the Move is increased by +2. 
This is referred to as ‘STAB’ for short.
Hit Point Loss
Effects that say “loses Hit Points” or that set Hit Points 
to a certain value instead of “deals damage” do not have 
Defensive Stats applied to these Hit Point changes nor 
cause Injuries from Massive Damage.
Critical Hits
On an Accuracy Roll of 20, a damaging attack is a 
Critical Hit. A Critical Hit adds the Damage Dice Roll 
a second time to the total damage dealt, but does not 
add Stats a second time; for example, a DB6 Move Crit 
would be 4d6+16+Stat, or 30+Stat going by set damage.
Some Moves or effects may cause increased critical 
ranges, making Critical Hits possible on Accuracy Rolls 
lower than 20. Some effects may also increase Critical 
Hit range; if an effect increases Critical Hit Range by 
4 for example, on most moves this would indicate a 
Critical Hit on accuracy rolls of 16-20. 
Note that increased Critical Hit ranges are not counted 
as an effect, and do not trigger Serene Grace or Sheer 
Force.

Injuries
If an attack deals enough damage, it might cause an 
Injury! Generally, this happens when an attack deals 
Massive Damage, or damage equal to or greater than 
50% of a target’s maximum Hit Points, or when a target 
is reduced to a certain Hit Point Marker: 50% of their 
maximum Hit Points, 0%, -50%, -100%, and every -50% 
thereafter. 
For more details on Injuries, their effects, and recovery, 
see page 250. 
Tick of Hit Points: Some effects use this term. A Tick of 
Hit Points is equal to 1/10th of someone’s maximum Hit 
Points. A Tick Value is what that amount is. 
Damage Formula
Putting this all together, the process for calculating 
damage is as follows: 
1.	 Find initial Damage Base 
2.	 Apply Five/Double-Strike 
3.	 Add Damage Base modifiers (ex: STAB) for final 
Damage Base 
4.	 Modify damage roll for Critical Hit if applicable 
5.	 Roll damage or use set damage
6.	 Add relevant attack stat and other bonuses 
7.	 Subtract relevant defense stat and damage reduction
8.	 Apply weakness and resistance multipliers. 
9.	 Subtract final damage from target’s Hit Points and 
check for Injuries or KO.
Damage Charts
Below we have provided two different Damage Charts. The first Damage Chart shows actual damage as a traditional 
roll. Simply roll the dice shown, adding the modifier next to it, and then add your Attack Stat to determine the 
total damage dealt. The “Set” Damage Chart displays three values. The value on the left is the minimum roll, the 
value on the right is the maximum, and the middle value in bold and red is the average roll, which you should use 
if you’re going to be using Set Damage. The other values are listed simply for reference. Which Chart you use is up 
to your GM; if combat is taking too long, consider using the Set Damage chart to speed up your game. Print this 
chart out and use it as a reference to make combat quicker in your game!

Type Effectiveness
This is the Type Effectiveness chart! Whenever a Move 
of one of the Types on the left targets a Pokémon, find 
its Type on the right to check for Type Effectiveness. 
Multiply the damage dealt, after defenses are applied, 
by the number shown above.
Note that Type Effectiveness does not generally affect 
Status Moves; only Physical and Special Moves are 
affected. Confuse Ray, for example, despite being Ghost 
type, is perfectly able to hit Normal Types.
Moves like Sonic Boom or Counter, on the other hand, 
despite having non-standard Damage, are affected by 
Immunity, though not by resistance.
Unlike Pokémon, Trainers do not have a Type, and thus 
all attacks by default do Neutral damage to them.
Type-Effectiveness is a bit more complicated if the 
defender has two types:
»»
If both Types are neutral, the attack of course is 
simply neutral
»»
If both Types are resistant, the attack is doubly 
resisted and does 1/4th damage
»»
If both Types are weak, the attack is doubly super-
effective and does x2 damage.
»»
If one Type is weak and one is resistant, the attack 
is neutral.
»»
If either Type is Immune, the attack does 0 damage.


## Page 239

Combat
239
»»
In cases where Pokémon gain more than two 
Types, attacks may be triply resisted or triply super-
effective. Triply resisted attacks do 1/8th damage, 
and triply super-effective attacks do x3 damage. 
Be sure to note that allied effects from Moves can ignore 
Immunity and effects that tell you to ignore all effects 
from a Type of Move. For example, Aromatherapy can 
affect allies even if those allies have Sap Sipper, and 
Aromatherapy does not trigger the Attack Combat 
Stage Boost on those allies. 
In addition to the Type Effectiveness for damaging 
attacks, several Types have their own quirks that are 
important in battle as well!
»»
Electric Types are immune to Paralysis
»»
Fire Types are immune to Burn
»»
Ghost Types cannot be Stuck or Trapped
»»
Grass Types are immune to the effects of all Moves 
with the Powder Keyword
»»
Ice Types are immune to being Frozen
»»
Poison and Steel Types are immune to Poison

Struggle Attacks
Struggle Attacks are weak and usually untrained attacks 
made in desperation by Trainers or Pokémon.
Struggle Attacks may be used by Pokémon and Trainers 
alike as a Standard Action.
Trainers without any Combat features often make these 
attacks if they try to hit something; Pokémon do so 
more rarely, but may do so if they wish to attack without 
seriously hurting the target, or are unable to use any 
Moves due to Suppression, Disable, or similar effects.
Struggle Attacks have an AC of 4 and a Damage Base of 
4, are Melee-Ranged, Physical, and Normal Type. They 
may be further modified by Capabilities. When Trainers 
use Struggle Attacks, these may be modified by Weapons 
the trainers are wielding. Never apply STAB to Struggle 
Attacks. Struggle Attacks do not count as Moves, and 
effects that alter Moves do not apply to them. 
Additionally, if a Trainer or Pokémon has a Combat 
Skill Rank of Expert or higher, Struggle Attacks instead 
have an AC of 3 and a Damage Base of 5.
Struggle Attack Modifying Capabilities
Firestarter: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Fire-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Fire-Type Moves grant 
Firestarter.
Fountain: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Water-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Water-Type Moves grant 
Fountain.
Freezer: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Ice-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack instead 
of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Ice-Type Moves grant Freezer.
Guster: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Flying-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Flying-Type Moves grant 
Guster.
Materializer: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Rock-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Rock-Type Moves grant 
Materializer.
Telekinetic: Telekinetic Pokémon and Trainers can move objects with their mind. They can lift things with Tele-
kinesis as if they were using a Power Capability equal to their Focus Rank. When lifting Staggering Weights with 
Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. They can target objects up to 8 me-
ters away. Count the combined weight of all objects when determining whether they can lift all of them. Using this 
Capability to lift the user’s Drag Weight or greater leaves discoverable psychic residue. Additionally, the user may 
use Struggle Attacks at a range of X, where X is the user’s Focus Rank. These Struggle Attacks deal Normal-Type 
Damage as usual, but the user may add their Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special 
Damage, if they wish. The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and Push Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic 
Capability and using the Focus Skill for all opposed rolls. When the Push Maneuver is used this way, the user does 
not repeat the Push but instead Pushes the target a number of meters equal to half their Focus Rank. If a Pokémon 
learns the Move Psychic or Telekinesis and does not have the Telekinetic Capability, they gain Telekinetic.
Zapper: The user’s struggle Attacks may be Electric-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. Multiple Electric-Type Moves grant 
Zapper.

Combat Maneuvers
Sometimes, the best option in a fight isn’t just to hit the 
other side as hard as you can. You can gain a tactical 
advantage on the field of battle by relieving an opponent 
of their weapon, momentarily tripping them, or even 
simply pushing them in a direction. 
Pokémon and Trainers can use all Combat Maneuvers, 
unless otherwise noted. The Combat Maneuvers are 
below: 
Maneuver: Attack of Opportunity
Action: Free
Trigger: See Below
Effect: You may make a Struggle Attack against the 
triggering foe as an Interrupt.  You may use Attack 
of Opportunity only once per round. Attacks of 
Opportunity cannot be made by Sleeping, Flinched, or 
Paralyzed targets.
Attacks of Opportunity can be triggered in multiple 
ways:
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Push, Grapple, Disarm, Trip, 
or Dirty Trick Maneuver that does not target you.
»»
An adjacent foe stands up. 
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Ranged Attack that does not 
target someone adjacent to it.
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Standard Action to pick up or 
retrieve an item.
»»
An adjacent foe Shifts out of a Square adjacent to 
you.  
Maneuver: Disengage
Action: Shift
Effect: You may Shift 1 Meter. Shifting this way does not 
provoke an Attack of Opportunity.
Maneuver: Disarm
Action: Standard
AC: 6
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat or 
Stealth Checks. If you win, the target’s Held Item (Main 
Hand or Off-Hand for humans) falls to the ground.
Maneuver: Dirty Trick
Action: Standard
AC: 2
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You may perform any of the Dirty Tricks listed 
below. You may use each trick only once each Scene per 
target.
Hinder
You and the target make Opposed 
Athletics Checks. If you win, the target is 
Slowed and takes a -2 penalty to all Skill 
Checks  for one full round. 
Blind
You and the target make Opposed Stealth 
Checks. If you win, the target is Blinded 
for one full round.
Low Blow
You and the target make Opposed Ac-
robatics Checks. If you win, the target is 
Vulnerable and has their Initiative set to 
0 until the end of your next turn.
Maneuver: Manipulate
Action: Standard
AC: 2
Class: Status
Range: 6, 1 Target
Effect: You may perform any of the Manipulations listed 
below. You may use each Manipulation only once each 
Scene per target. Manipulate can only be performed by 
Trainers.
Bon Mot
Make a Guile Check, opposed by the 
target’s Guile or Focus. If you win, the 
target is Enraged and cannot spend AP for 
one full round. The target does not gain a 
Save Check against this effect. 
Flirt
Make a Charm Check, opposed by the 
target’s Charm or Focus. If you win, the 
target is Infatuated with you for one full 
round. The target automatically fails their 
Save Check.
Terrorize Make an Intimidate Check, opposed by the 
target’s Intimidate or Focus. If you win, the 
target loses all Temporary Hit Points and 
can only use At-Will Frequency Moves for 
one full round.


## Page 242

Combat
242
Maneuver: Push
Action: Standard
AC: 4
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Athletics Checks. If you win, the target is Pushed 
back 1 Meter directly away from you. If you have Move-
ment remaining this round, you may then Move into 
the newly occupied Space, and Push the target again. 
This continues until you choose to stop, or have no 
Movement remaining for the round. Push may only be 
used against a target whose weight is no heavier than 
your Heavy Lifting rating.
 
Maneuver: Sprint
Action: Standard
Class: Status
Range: Self
Effect: Increase your Movement Speeds by 50% for the 
rest of your turn.
 
Maneuver: Trip
Action: Standard
AC: 6
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Acrobatics Checks. If you win, the target is knocked 
over and Tripped.
 
Maneuver: Intercept Melee
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: An ally within Movement range is hit by an 
adjacent foe.
Effect: You must make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check, with a DC equal to three times the number of 
meters they have to move to reach the triggering Ally; If 
you succeed, you Push the triggering Ally 1 Meter away 
from you, and Shift to occupy their space, and are hit by 
the triggering attack. On Failure to make the Check, the 
user still Shifts a number of meters equal a third of their 
check result.
Note: If the target that was Intercepted was hit by an 
Area of Effect Move, and the 1 meter push does not 
remove them from the Area of Effect, the Intercept has 
no effect since they are still in the area of the attack – 
it would cause the Interceptor to be hit by the Move 
however.
Maneuver: Intercept Ranged
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: A Ranged X-Target attack passes within your 
Movement Range.
Effect: Select a Square within your Movement Range 
that lies directly between the source of the attack and 
the target of the attack. Make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check; you may Shift a number of Meters equal to half 
the result towards the chosen square. If you succeed, 
you take the attack instead of its intended target. If you 
fail, you still Shift a number of Meters equal to half the 
result.
Special: Pokemon must have a Loyalty of 3 or greater to 
make Intercept Melee and Intercept Range Maneuvers, 
and may only Intercept attacks against their Trainer. At 
Loyalty 6, Pokemon may Intercept for any Ally.
Additional Rules
»»
Pokémon and Trainers may only Intercept against 
Priority and Interrupt Moves if they are faster than 
the user of those Moves.
»»
Moves that cannot miss (such as Aura Sphere or 
Swift) cannot be Intercepted.
»»
Pokémon and Trainers cannot attempt Intercepts if 
they are Asleep, Confused, Enraged, Frozen, Stuck, 
Paralyzed, or otherwise unable to move.
»»
Intercepts may not be used to move the Intercepting 
Pokémon or Trainer OUT of the way of an attack. 
They will always be hit, regardless.

Combat
243
Maneuver: Grapple
Action: Standard
AC: 4
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Com-
bat or Athletics Checks. If you win, you and the target 
each become Grappled, and you gain Dominance in the 
Grapple.
Pokémon and Trainers that are Grappled
»»
Are Vulnerable
»»
Cannot take Shift Actions, or any actions that would 
cause them to Shift.
»»
Gain a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls if targeting any-
one outside of the Grapple.
»»
Additionally, Grapple has other effects on whether 
the target has or doesn’t have Dominance.
If a target begins their turn as a part of a Grapple but 
with no Dominance, they may choose to contest the 
Grapple as a Full Action. If they do, all participants 
make opposed Combat or Athletics Check. Whoever 
wins then may choose to either continue the Grapple 
and gain Dominance, or to end the Grapple.
If a target has the Phasing or Teleporter Capability, they 
may also use those to escape from a Grapple on their 
turn with no check required. 
If a target begins their turn as part of a Grapple and has 
Dominance, they may take one of the following actions 
as a Full Action.
»»
End the Grapple.
»»
Secure: They gain a +3 Bonus to the next opposed 
check they make in the Grapple.
»»
Attack: They may automatically hit with an Un-
armed Struggle Attack.
»»
Move: They Shift, dragging the other person in the 
grapple with them. The user’s Movement Capability 
is lowered by the other grappler’s Weight Class.

Improvised Attacks
You aren’t limited to Moves and simple Struggle Attacks 
in a battle. Oftentimes, you will attempt a maneuver 
that isn’t strictly outlined by the rules, such as using a 
rock as an improvised throwing weapon or attempting 
to push a nearly-felled tree onto an opponent. 
The general rule here is that if the maneuver isn’t very 
limited by resources or the environment and is easily 
replicable, then it should have a lesser effect than any 
well-defined counterparts in Moves or Weapons. A 
penalty to AC and Damage Base is often appropriate, 
and for non-damaging attacks, a reduction in the 
attack’s effect.
For example, it’s easy for any Trainer to grab a handful 
of dirt or sand while in the outdoors or even from a 
prepared bag to throw in an opponent’s face without 
knowing the Move Sand Attack. Rather than Sand 
Attack’s effect, your GM might treat this as an AC 5 
attack that reduces a foe’s Accuracy by -2 until the end 
of their next turn. 
In the case of improvised attacks with common 
implements that have a Type association such as 
throwing a rock or snowball, you would nonetheless 
treat them as Normal Type attacks in most cases because 
it otherwise becomes far too easy to gain Type coverage. 
A thrown rock does Normal Type damage for the same 
reason that Geodude can do Normal Damage with a 
Tackle Move. It takes a certain oomph behind an attack 
to give it a Type. 
On the other hand, if you’re trying to hit someone with 
a torch to deal Fire Type damage with your Struggle 
Attack, your GM could rule you can do so – but only 
once before the torch breaks from the impact. 
More elaborate improvised attacks may warrant a Typing 
or even emulating an effect similar to many Moves. For 
example, if you push a boulder on a mountain in a way 
that it unleashes a landslide on your foes, your GM 
might rule that as a Rock Slide attack and let you roll 
as if using the Move. A GM might require Skill Checks 
to be made to pull off some of these trickier maneuvers. 
and base the attacking stat’s value off of these Skills. For 
example, a Survival Check to trigger the landslide and 
then Survival Rank times three for Attack Stat. Given 
that this kind of situation is likely rare, hard to repeat in 
the same battle, and difficult to deliberately set up, it’s a 
good idea to reward players for taking advantage of the 
environment in this manner. 
Environmental Attack Effects
Attacks and Moves aren’t just techniques to injure 
living targets. They’ll often have effects on the target’s 
possessions or may be useful for manipulating the 
environment. 
For example, a powerful Water or Electric Type attack 
could soak a Trainer’s electronics or short-circuit them 
if they aren’t properly protected. For most common 
devices like cell phones, they might be rendered 
inoperable until repaired or at least until the end of 
the Scene, but when it comes to specialty items such 
as Capture Stylers, Snag Machines, and Class-related 
items, special shielding or waterproofing may allow 
them to be used again in as quickly as three rounds. 
A Blizzard Move that freezes a Trainer may ice their 
Potions and render them useless until thawed, or a 
Flamethrower might burn up Herbs and Apricorns a 
Trainer carelessly left in their pockets before wandering 
into battle.
GMs should take note not to overuse this idea to punish 
Trainers. Generally, Trainers should be assumed to have 
a holster or small pack that can hold a small handful of 
consumables like Potions which is protected from most 
external harm. Nonetheless, it’s a good idea for Trainers 
to set down their backpacks full of valuables before they 
get into a fight to avoid having anything destroyed as 
collateral damage. 
Attacks and Moves don’t have to target Pokémon or 
Trainers either. A Trainer might order their Charizard 
to use a Flamethrower attack in the woods to start a 
forest fire, a Conkeldurr might bash down a door with a 
Superpower, or a Pikachu may zap a server cluster with 
a Thunder Shock to destroy it.
These effects don’t have to be intentional either. A GM 
should take into account the logical effects of Moves on 
the environment, even if a player has forgotten when 
they order Torkoal to use Overheat in a paper factory.

Other Actions in Combat
Take a Breather 
Trainers and Pokémon can Take a Breather and 
temporarily remove themselves from the heat of 
combat to recover from Confusion and other Volatile 
Status Afflictions, though they still must pass any Save 
Checks to be able to take this action and do so. Taking 
a Breather is a Full Action and requires a Pokémon or 
Trainer to use their Shift Action to move as far away 
from enemies as possible, using their highest available 
Movement Capability. They then become Tripped and 
are Vulnerable until the end of their next turn. 
When a Trainer or Pokémon Takes a Breather, they 
set their Combat Stages back to their default level, lose 
all Temporary Hit Points, and are cured of all Volatile 
Status effects and the Slow and Stuck conditions. To be 
cured of Cursed in this way, the source of the Curse must 
either be Knocked Out or no longer within 12 meters at 
the end of the Shift triggered by Take a Breather. 
When a Trainer or Pokémon is unable to choose to Take 
a Breather themselves, such as when they are inflicted 
with the Rage Status Affliction or when someone doesn’t 
want to take a chance on passing a Confusion Save 
Check, they may be calmed and assisted by a Trainer to 
attempt to Take a Breather. 
This is a Full Action by both the assisting Trainer and their 
target (as an Interrupt for the target), and the assisting 
Trainer must be able to Shift to the target they intend to 
help. They then make a Command Check with a DC of 
12. Upon success, both the assisting Trainer and their 
target must Shift as far away from enemies as possible, 
using the lower of the two’s maximum movement for 
a single Shift. They then both become Tripped and are 
treated as having 0 Evasion until the end of their next 
turn. The Trainer that has been assisted then gains all 
the effects of Taking a Breather. Upon a failure, nothing 
happens, and the assisted Trainer is not cured of their 
Status Afflictions. 
Precision Skill Checks
Skills can be used during combat just like any other 
time, but it is significantly more difficult to perform 
precise and careful actions while under attack. 
When a Trainer or Pokémon performs such a Skill 
Check after having been attacked, successfully or not, in 
either the current or the previous round of combat, they 
must make a Focus Check in addition to their normal 
Skill Check. This Focus Check has a DC of 16. Failure 
imposes a -1 penalty to their normal Skill Check, and for 
each increment of 4 by which the Trainer or Pokémon 
fails, they take an additional -1 penalty.
If the Trainer or Pokémon was successfully hit by a 
damaging attack in the current or previous round, they 
automatically take a -2 penalty to their normal Skill 
Check on top of the penalties imposed by the Focus 
Check. And if they were Injured in the current or 
previous rounds, they take an additional -2 penalty to 
their check per Injury gained in that time. 
It is important to note that this doesn’t apply to most 
Skill Checks to activate Features, Moves, Abilities, 
Capabilities, or to perform Combat Maneuvers. Apply 
these rules only when a Trainer or Pokémon performs 
very delicate tasks in the middle of battle such as a 
Stealth Check to pick a lock, a Technology Education 
Check to precisely mix a batch of volatile chemicals, or 
a Survival Check to carefully harvest the fragile parts of 
a rare flower.

Status Afflictions
Many Moves and effects inflict Status Afflictions on their 
victims. There are two main kinds of Status Afflictions; 
Persistent and Volatile. There are also other conditions 
which are technically not Status Afflictions and cannot 
be cured as such. Many Status Afflictions allow Save 
Checks which allow the user to end or mitigate the effect. 
Save Checks are always 1d20. Unlike the video games, 
there is no limit to the number of Status Afflictions that 
a single target can have. 
Persistent Afflictions
Persistent Afflictions are retained even if the Pokémon 
is recalled into its Poké Ball. Sleeping Pokémon will 
naturally awaken given time, and Frozen Pokémon can 
be thawed as an Extended Action after combat. Burned, 
Paralyzed, and Poisoned Pokémon must be treated with 
items or at a Pokémon Center to be cured, however. All 
Persistent Status conditions are cured if the target is 
Fainted.
Burned: The target’s Defense Stat is lowered by 2 Combat 
Stages for the duration of the Burn. Fire-Type Pokémon 
are immune to becoming Burned. If a Burned Target 
takes a Standard Action or is prevented from taking a 
Standard Action by an effect such as Sleep, Flinch, or 
Paralysis, they lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of 
that turn. 
Frozen: The target may not act on their turn and receives 
no bonuses from Evasion. At the end of each turn, the 
target may make a DC 16 Save Check to become cured. 
This DC is lowered to 11 for Fire-Type Pokémon, and 
Ice-Type Pokémon are immune to becoming Frozen. 
If a Frozen Target is hit by a Damaging Fire, Fighting, 
Rock, or Steel Attack, they are cured of the Frozen 
Condition. Save Checks to cure this condition receive 
a +4 Bonus in Sunny Weather, and a -2 Penalty in Hail.
Paralysis: The Target’s Speed Stat is lowered by 4 
Combat Stages. At the beginning of each turn the 
target is paralyzed, they must roll a DC 5 Save Check. 
If they succeed, they may act normally; if they do not, 
they cannot take any Standard, Shift, or Swift Actions. 
Electric Type Pokémon are immune to Paralysis. 
Poisoned: The target’s Special Defense Value is 
lowered by 2 Combat Stages for the duration of the 
poison. Poison and Steel-Type Pokémon are immune 
to becoming Poisoned. If a Poisoned Target takes a 
Standard Action or is prevented from taking a Standard 
Action by an effect such as Sleep, Flinch, or Paralysis, 
they lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of that turn. 
When Badly Poisoned, the afflicted instead loses 5 Hit 
Points; this amount is doubled each consecutive round 
(10, 20, 40, etc).
Note: A reminder! A Tick of Hit Points is equal to 
1/10th of a Pokémon or Trainer’s Maximum Hit Points.

Volatile Afflictions
Volatile Afflictions are cured completely at the end of 
the encounter, and from Pokémon by recalling them 
into their Poké Balls. When Pokémon are Fainted, they 
are automatically cured of all Volatile Status Afflictions.
Bad Sleep: Whenever the user makes a Save Check to 
save against Sleep, they lose two ticks of Hit Points. Bad 
Sleep may only afflict Sleeping targets; if the target is 
cured of Sleep, they are also cured of Bad Sleep.
Confused: At the beginning of their turn, a confused 
target must roll a Save Check.
»»
On a roll of 1-8, the confused target hits itself using 
a Typeless Physical Struggle Attack as a Standard 
Action and may take no other actions this turn. This 
attack automatically hits, and deals damage as if it’s 
resisted 1 Step. 
»»
On a roll of 9-15, the target may act normally.
»»
On a roll of 16 or higher, the target is cured of 
confusion.
Cursed: If a Cursed Target takes a Standard Action, 
they lose two ticks of Hit Points at the end of that turn. 
Disabled: When the user gains the Disabled Affliction, 
a specific Move is specified. The user cannot use that 
Move as long as they remain Disabled. Pokémon or 
Trainers may have multiple instances of the Disabled 
Condition, each specifying a different Move.
Rage: While enraged, the target must use a Damaging 
Physical or Special Move or Struggle Attack.  At the end 
of each turn, roll a DC15 Save Check; if they succeed, 
they are cured of Rage.
Flinch: You may not take actions during your next turn 
that round. The Flinched Status does not carry over 
onto the next round.
Infatuation: At the beginning of each turn you are 
infatuated, roll a Save Check. 
»»
On a result of 1-10, you may not target the Pokémon 
or Trainer that you are Infatuated towards with a 
Move or Attack, but may otherwise Shift and use 
actions normally. 
»»
On 11-18 you may use a Move and Shift without 
restriction. 
»»
On a roll of 19 or higher, you are cured of the 
Infatuation.
Sleep: Sleeping Trainers and Pokémon receive no 
bonuses from Evasion, and cannot take actions except 
for Free and Swift Actions that would cure Sleep (ex: 
activating the Shed Skin Ability). At the end of the 
sleeper’s turns, they may make a DC 16 Save Check to 
wake up. Whenever a Sleeping Pokémon takes Damage 
or loses life from an Attack, they wake up. This does 
not include loss of life from passive sources such as 
Poison or Burns, but active attacks and effects that cause 
Hit Point loss (such as being hit by the Press Feature, 
or Super Fang) would wake up their target. Sleeping 
targets cannot make Save Checks to be cured of Rage, 
Infatuation, or Confusion, but they also cannot hurt 
themselves in Confusion. Pokémon and Trainers may 
wake an adjacent ally as a Standard Action.
Suppressed: While Suppressed, Pokémon and Trainers 
cannot benefit from PP Ups, and have the frequency of 
their Moves lowered; At-Will Moves become EOT, and 
EOT and Scene x2 Moves become Scene.
Temporary Hit Points: Some effects grant Temporary 
Hit Points. Temporary Hit Points are not “healed” away 
by effects that cure Status Conditions, but it is lost if the 
user is recalled in a Poké Ball, and disappears on its own 
after 5 minutes while outside of combat.
Temporary Hit Points are “bonus” health that stacks on 
top of “real” Hit Points - so you can benefit from gaining 
it even if you are already at full health. 
However, Temporary Hit Points are always lost first 
from damage or any other effects. Damage carries over 
directly to real Hit Points once the Temporary Hit 
Points are lost. Furthermore, Temporary Hit Points do 
not stack with other Temporary Hit Points – only the 
highest value applies.
For example, if you have 10 Temporary Hit Points, and 
then gain 8 Temporary Hit Points - nothing happens. If 
the next turn you were then to gain 15 Temporary Hit 
Points, your Temporary Hit Points would go up to 15 
since that is the highest value.
Temporary Hit Points also do not stack with “Real” Hit 
Points for the purposes of determining percentages of 
Hit Points. If a Pokémon has exactly 1 real Hit Point and 
has 50 Temporary Hit Points, they would use the Moves 
and effects as if they have 1 Hit Point, not 51.

Other Afflictions
These effects are listed here for reference, but they do 
not count as true “Status Afflictions”. Moves, items, 
features, and other effects that heal Status Afflictions 
cannot fix these effects.
Fainted: A Pokémon or Trainer that is at 0 Hit Points or 
lower is Fainted, or Knocked Out. A Fainted Pokémon 
or Trainer is unconscious due to injuries or other effects, 
and cannot use any Actions, Abilities, or Features unless 
the Feature or Ability specifically says otherwise. 
The “Fainted” Condition is removed only by specific 
items such as Revive, or by being brought up to a 
positive Hit Point count by healing Features or Moves 
such as Wish or Heal Pulse. Potions and other healing 
items may still bring a Pokémon above 0 Hit Points, 
but it remains Fainted for another 10 minutes. When 
a Pokémon becomes Fainted, they are automatically 
cured of all Persistent and Volatile Status Conditions.
Blindness: Blindness represents the target’s vision 
becoming obscured.  A Blinded Pokémon or Trainer 
receives a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls, and must make 
an Acrobatics Check with a DC of 10 when traveling over 
Rough or Slow Terrain or become Tripped. Blindness 
is caused by several effects. This is in perpetual effect 
in deep darkness, unless the target has Blindsense or 
Darkvision. Pokémon or Trainers with Blindsense 
cannot be Blinded.
Total Blindness: Total Blindness is more than just 
obscured vision; it’s total and complete sightlessness, 
such as experienced in a completely dark cave or 
building interior. Total Blindness has the same 
disadvantages as Blindness, and more. Totally Blinded 
Pokémon or Trainers have no awareness of the map, 
and must declare any shifts as distance relative to them. 
Totally Blinded targets receive a -10 total Penalty to 
Accuracy Rolls, and cannot use Moves with Priority or 
as Interrupts. When making a Shift action, they must 
declare if they are moving Slowly or Quickly; moving 
Slowly restricts Movement as if Slowed. Moving Quickly 
has no Movement Penalty, but if the user attempts to 
Shift into Blocking Terrain, Rough Terrain, or Slow 
Terrain, they become Tripped. Pokémon or Trainers 
with Blindesense cannot be Totally Blinded.
Slowed: A Pokémon that is Slowed has its Movement 
halved (minimum 1). This condition may be removed 
by switching, or at the end of a Scene as an Extended 
Action.
Stuck: A Pokémon or Trainer that is Stuck cannot make 
a Shift Action to move and cannot apply their Speed 
Evasion to attacks. This condition may be removed by 
switching, or at the end of an Scene as an Extended 
Action. Ghost Type Pokémon are immune to the Stuck 
Condition.
Trapped: A Pokémon or Trainer that is Trapped cannot 
be recalled. Ghost Type Pokémon are immune to the 
Trapped Condition.
Tripped: A Pokémon or Trainer has been Tripped needs 
to spend a Shift Action getting up before they can take 
further actions. 
Vulnerable: A Vulnerable Pokémon or Trainer cannot 
apply Evasion of any sort against attacks.

Miscellaneous Rules
These rules may come into play out of combat as well, 
but they’re most likely to show up in battles, depending 
on the environment. Suffocation and drowning are real 
threats when a fight takes place on the high seas, and 
pushing an opponent off a cliff or tall building is an easy 
way to end a fight early. 
Suffocating
After 1 minute (or 6 rounds), every round a Pokémon 
or Trainer goes without air, they start to suffocate. Take 
1 Injury per round suffocating. These injuries can’t be 
healed by anything except breathing; once the target 
can breathe again, they are healed of these injuries. 
Pokémon or Trainers with the Gilled capability do not 
suffocate from being in water.
Falling Damage
Taking a fall can be nasty for trainers and Pokémon. 
Damage is taken as if it was a Typeless Physical Attack, 
with a Damage Base dependent on the distance of the 
fall and the weight class of the poor victim. 
Weight Class 1 & 2:
+1 DB per meter fallen, 
maximum DB 20. 
Weight Class 3 to 6:
+2 DB per meter fallen, 
maximum DB 28.
Also consider the following rules:
»»
In addition to the damage, trainers and Pokémon 
that fall 4 or more meters take 1 injury for every 
2 meters fallen. Pokémon with natural Sky Speeds 
take 1 Injury for every 3 meters instead, as their 
bodies have evolved to take potential crashes better.
»»
Falling on a yielding surface may let you ignore 
anywhere from 1 to 6 meters of falling, to your GM’s 
discretion; 1 would be soft grass, 3 might be a stack 
of mattresses, 6 would be deep water. Other surfaces 
may increase the falling damage; falling onto rocky 
terrain may increase the falling distance by +1. 
Some surfaces may even be volatile; falling onto a 
tree from above may increase the falling damage by 
+1d6, depending on whether you get cut up by a tree 
branch or not. Deciding on an appropriate modifier 
depending on the surface will be up to your GM.
»»
If a Pokémon or Trainer intentionally jumps rather 
than falling, they may ignore a number of meters 
equal to their High Jump value. This includes any 
bonuses from Acrobatics Checks or running starts; 
this means Pokémon or trainers can’t be hurt by their 
own jumps (well, unless a surface says differently of 
course…)
»»
When falling, Trainers and Pokémon may make an 
Acrobatics Check with a DC of 12; if the fall was 
unintentional, the DC is instead 20. Upon success, 
they may ignore one additional Meter when 
calculating Fall damage.
For example, 2 trainers fall from a high rooftop. The 
building is 5 stories tall, or about 15 meters high. Both 
are Weight Class 3, both have 40/40 Hit Points, and a 
defense of 5. They both fail their acrobatics checks.
One is lucky and lands on an awning 5 meters down; 
their GM decides the bouncy awning lets this trainer 
ignore the first 2 meters of falling. They take damage 
for falling 3 meters, thus the damage is Damage Base 
6, or 2d6+8. They roll, getting a fairly average roll of 
14, and thus taking 9 damage. But the poor trainer isn’t 
done falling; he falls off the awning, the rest of the 10 
meters onto a pile of garbage. The GM decides that, 
again, the pile of garbage lets him ignore 2 meters. So 
he takes damage for falling 8 meters – or 26 feet.  That’s 
a Damage Base of 16, or 5d10+20. He rolls, getting 
an above-average roll of 56. He takes the 51 damage, 
leaving him at -20. He gains 1 Injury from Massive 
Damage, and 3 Injuries from Hit Point Markers (50%, 
0, -50%). Since he fell more than 4 meters during that 
last stretch, he gains 4 more injuries. He’s left at -20 Hit 
Points and with 8 Injuries – he’s definitely going to need 
medical attention. 
The other trainer is less lucky and falls the entire 15 
meters straight down onto the parking lot below. He 
thus takes a whopping Damage Base 28 attack; he rolls 
the 8d12+80, and comes out to 140 damage. Even with 
his defense, the 135 damage puts the trainer at -95 Hit 
Points, which is under -200% of his Hit Points.  And 
with 14 injuries, this unlucky trainer is very dead either 
way.

Gaining Injuries
Even the toughest Pokémon or Trainer will become 
injured if they take heavy hits. In the course of battle, 
your Pokémon are likely to gain Injuries.
There are two ways of gaining injuries; Massive Damage 
and passing certain Hit Point Markers. 
Massive Damage is any single attack or damage source 
that does damage equal to 50% or more of their Max Hit 
Points. Whenever a Pokémon or trainer suffers Massive 
Damage, they gain 1 Injury. Massive Damage Injuries 
are never gained from Moves that cause you to “Set” or 
“lose” Hit Points, such as a Pain Split or Endeavor.
The Hit Point Markers are 50% of maximum Hit Points, 
0%, -50%, -100%, and every -50% lower thereafter. 
Whenever a Pokémon or Trainer reaches one of these 
Hit Point values, they take 1 Injury. 
For example, a Pokémon or Trainer that goes from Max 
Hit Points to -150% Hit Points after receiving a single 
attack would gain 6 Injuries (1 for Massive Damage, and 
5 for Hit Point Markers). 
Doxy: When GMing, if a Pokémon or Trainer gains an 
Injury, it’s better to describe the injury than 
to just say “you are injured’” You could say 
for example, “You have a gash on your arm, 
scratches on your cheek, and a large bruise on your 
side” instead of “you have 3 injuries”. For the most part, 
Injuries in PTU are along the lines of these quickly 
healed wounds rather than broken bones and more 
lasting effects that would take weeks to heal.
Dealing with Injuries
For each Injury a Pokémon or Trainer has, their 
Maximum Hit Points are reduced by 1/10th. For 
example, a Pokémon with 3 injuries and 50 Max Hit 
Points could only heal up to 35 Hit Points, or 7/10ths of 
their maximum. The artificial Max Hit Point number is 
not considered when potentially acquiring new injuries, 
or when dealing with any other effects such as Poison 
that consider fractional damage, or when dealing with 
Hit Point Markers. All Effects that normally go off the 
Pokémon’s Max Hit Points still use the real maximum.
See the ‘Resting’ section (page 252) for details on 
removing injuries. 
Normal healing does not remove injuries; if a Pokémon 
is brought down to 50% Hit Points and is healed by, 
for example, a Heal Pulse, the injury is not removed. 
If they’re then brought down to 50% again, they gain 
another Injury for passing the 50% Hit Points Marker 
again. Using Healing to push Pokémon or Trainers past 
their limits can thus be potentially dangerous, as it gives 
multiple opportunities to gain Injuries.
Optional Rule: If you really want to invoke a feeling 
of desperation, you may want to give more penalties 
for having Injuries. A good way to do this is to lower 
a random Combat Stage whenever you gain an Injury, 
and let that dictate the location of the Injury. A blow 
to the leg could be a reduction in Speed for example, 
or a blow to the arm could be a reduction in Attack. 
These Combat Stage losses would be permanent until 
the Injury is removed. Be careful using this rule with 
Lashers! You may wish to rule that Injuries triggered by 
their Features don’t trigger this rule.
Heavily Injured
Whenever a Trainer or Pokémon has 5 or more injuries, 
they are considered Heavily Injured. Whenever a 
Heavily Injured Trainer or Pokémon takes a Standard 
Action during combat, or takes Damage from an attack, 
they lose Hit Points equal to the number of Injuries they 
currently have. Only the foolish and desperate fight 
when Heavily Injured. 
Dev Note: Why do we have an Injury system? Our many 
campaigns of experience with PTA have taught us that 
it’s really boring when a single Pokémon or Trainer can 
be knocked down to nearly fainting and then brought 
up to full health by items or healing Moves upwards of 
a half dozen times per battle. It makes battles drag on 
forever, and it hurts a GM’s ability to create tense and 
interesting challenges. 
Injuries limit how far healing can carry any single 
combatant in one fight and thus also force you to use 
more of your team instead of relying on one Pokémon 
in every fight. They’re not meant to be huge hassles, but 
they help create a sense of tension and risk.
Injuries

Death
Pushing Pokémon or Trainers to their limits can result 
in even worse than Injuries – death. If a Pokémon or 
Trainer has 10 injuries, or goes down to either -50 Hit 
Points or -200% Hit Points, whichever is lower (in that 
-80 Hit Points is lower than -50 Hit Points), during a 
non-friendly match, they die.
Generally Pokémon can hold back when instructed to, or 
when competing in “friendly” or at least sportsmanlike 
matches such as during League events or Gym Matches 
– in situations like this, simply pay no heed to the -50/-
200% damage rule.
Injuries are a different issue – the 10 Injuries Rule 
always applies. However, it is difficult for a Pokémon 
that is perfectly healthy to reach 10 Injuries in a single 
match, so by taking proper care of your Pokémon, this 
can be avoided.
Coup de Grâce
Any Pokémon or Trainer can attempt a Coup de Grâce 
against a Fainted or otherwise completely helpless 
target as a Full Action. Simply, the Pokémon or Trainer 
makes any Attack or Move they could normally make as 
a Standard Action, but this attack must target only the 
target of the Coup de Grâce.
If the Coup de Grâce hits, the attack is automatically a 
Critical Hit that deals +5 bonus damage (multiply this 
damage as part of the critical hit; this will normally make 
it +10, but Pokémon or Trainers with Sniper would add 
+15), ignoring any immunities to Critical Hits. 
Please note: Coup de Grâce rules do not work against 
Trainers or Pokémon simply due to Status Conditions 
such as Sleep or Paralysis; they must be either KO’d, or 
properly bound and made helpless. 
Furthermore, these Coup de Grâce rules are included 
for the sake of completeness when attempting to finish 
off a wounded opponent in the heat of battle; there’s no 
reason to force this mechanic outside of battle where a 
chance of failure does not make sense. All in all, use this 
rule at your GM’s discretion.
Doxy: Injury and Death mechanics are easily removed 
if you feel they do not fit the tone of your 
campaign. You can remove just one or both 
as you like, and of course you are free to alter 
them as well. To make things slightly easier 
for example, you could rule that Pokémon Centers can 
heal all Injuries each day. 
That said, these rules have been included because we feel 
they help keep the tension high during your adventures, 
and give Trainers incentives to use a varied team to help 
their Pokémon avoid being overtaxed. If you choose to 
remove Injuries, be conscious that this may affect the 
balance of other Features and effects that depend on 
Injuries as a limiting factor.


## Page 252

Combat
252
Resting
Sleep and extended rests can help restore the Hit Points 
of wounded Pokémon and Trainers. “Rest” is described 
as any period of time during which a trainer or Pokémon 
does not engage in rigorous physical or mental activity. 
What activities precisely are and aren’t “rest” is up to 
your GM’s discretion; usually rest means sleep, or at 
least sitting down for a while. Meals can often count 
as “rest” time. Traveling for extended periods of time 
almost never counts as “Rest”.
For the first 8 hours of rest each day, Pokémon and 
Trainers that spend a continuous half hour resting heal 
1/16th of their Maximum Hit Points.  You may continue 
to rest further after this time, but Hit Points will not 
be regained. Also, a Trainer or Pokémon is unable to 
restore Hit Points through rest if the individual has 5 
or more injuries. Once the individual has 4 or fewer 
injuries (usually by seeking medical attention), he or 
she may once again restore Hit Points by resting.
If a Pokémon or Trainer has an Injury, they can naturally 
heal from a single Injury if they go 24 hours without 
gaining any new injuries. Trainers can also remove 
Injuries as an Extended Action by Draining 2 AP. This 
is subject to the limitations on healing Injuries each day.
Extended Rests are rests that are at least 4 continuous 
hours long. Extended rests completely remove Persistent 
Status Conditions, and restore a Trainer’s Drained AP. 
Daily-Frequency Moves are also regained during an 
Extended Rest, if the Move hasn’t been used since the 
previous day.
Pokémon Centers
Pokémon Centers use expensive and advanced machin-
ery to heal Pokémon. In a mere hour, Pokémon Centers 
can heal a Trainers and Pokémon back to full health, 
heal all Status Conditions, and restore the Frequency of 
Daily-Frequency Moves.
Injuries however, may delay the time spent healing 
a Pokémon Center. For each Injury on the Trainer or 
Pokémon, Healing takes an additional 30 minutes.  If 
the Trainer or Pokémon has five or more Injuries, it 
takes one additional hour per Injury instead.
Pokémon Centers can remove a maximum of 3 Injuries 
per day; Injuries cured through natural healing, 
Bandages, or Features count toward this total. 
We recommend Pokémon Centers be FREE to use, but this of course varies by setting. Even if you don’t include 
explicit Pokémon Centers in the style of the anime and video games in your campaign, it’s a good idea to create 
equivalent medical institutions, such as hospitals, town doctors, or even medicine men who serve the same 
mechanical purpose as a Pokémon Center in providing access to healing and a way for Pokémon to recuperate 
from Injuries more easily.

The Scenario
Sylvana, from the Character Creation chapter, is an aspiring Trainer who’s been traveling with her Cyndaquil, 
Archie, for a week or so. She’s decided that she wants to catch another Pokémon to add to her team, so she’s set out 
for a local lakefront to see what the wildlife is like there. In her impatience, she’s left her friend, Maya, behind and 
stumbles upon three wild Oddish going about their daily business. What will happen? 
The Stats
For easy reference, here are the crucial numbers for this encounter. In the case of trainers, only the stats absolutely 
needed to demonstrate the encounter are listed, while the Pokémon are fully statted. 
Sylvana is an Ace Trainer and an Athlete, and she’s Leveled Up a bit since her debut in the Character Creation 
chapter. Lisa, her player, has her Athletics to Adept (Rank 4) which means her Poké Ball Throwing Range is 8 
meters (4 meters by default + another 4 meters for her Athletics rank) and her Overland Speed is 6 meters (4 
meters from her Adept Athletics and 2 meters from her Untrained Acrobatics).
Her relevant combat stats are: 57 Hit Points, 7 Attack, 5 Sp. Defense, 10 Speed. With Athlete’s Trained Stats, she 
instead has 8 Attack and 12 Speed. 
Maya is a Martial Artist and a Tumbler. Her relevant combat stats are: 12 Attack, 8 Speed
Archie is Sylvana’s Cyndaquil. He is Level 14 and has a Hardy Nature. 
His combat stats are: 60 Hit Points, 12 HP stat, 3 Attack, 4 Defense, 14 Special Attack, 5 Special Defense, and 16 
Speed. With Sylvana’s Agility Training applied, his Overland Speed is 6 meters, and his Initiative is 20. With Ace 
Trainer applied, his Special Attack is 16.
The wild Oddishes are Level 13 and all have neutral Natures.
They all share these combat stats: 53 Hit Points, 10 HP stat, 5 Attack, 12 Defense, 14 Special Attack, 13 Special 
Defense, and 3 Speed.

GM: Alright Sylvana, you’ve gone on ahead of Maya and found your way to the lakeside. Turning to your right, 
there’s an area of heavy brush. Since this is your first time dealing with it, I’ll let you know now that it’s rough and 
slow terrain which means you’ll have a harder time targeting and moving through it. Maya, you’ll have to wait a 
while to pop in the scene because you got left behind.
Sylvana: Got it. Well, I’m here to catch Pokémon, so what do I see? I’ll turn toward Archie and ask him if he’s 
noticed anything. “Hey Archie, you see any Pokémon around? Maybe something hiding in that thick brush over 
there.”
GM: Archie perks up and sends small gouts of flame pointing in a few directions. Following his guide, you notice a 
few weeds that seem to be moving around. One’s floating in the shallow water near the shore, one’s past the heavy 
brush, and another is rustling about on land near the shore. 
Sylvana: Aha! Oddish, right? I grin and start to pull a Poké Ball out of my pocket. “Grass types! Should be a piece 
of cake.” 
GM: So you’re jumping straight into combat? We can do that. The Oddish look pretty scared of you anyhow, since 
you’re carrying a fire type with you. A Cyndaquil’s open flame stands out a lot! Lemme just draw up a quick map 
and we can start…

Round One
GM: Okay, tallying up your speeds, the initiative order 
will be Archie, then Sylvana, then the three Oddish. 
Archie’s up – take your Pokémon turn. 
Sylvana: I don’t really want to deal with three Oddish 
bearing down on me at once. Good thing I used Ace 
Trainer on Archie earlier today to raise his Special 
Attack by one Combat Stage. It’s up to 16 now, and 
I’ve Drained 1 Action Point today. I applied Agility 
Training, so his Overland is increased to 6. And 
then…“Archie, throw up a smokescreen near the bushes 
so that one will stay out of our way!” Since it’s my turn 
right after, I’ll shift up closer to the Oddish on land 
near the lake and throw a Poké Ball with my Standard 
Action.
GM: Smart move that first one, but whoa are you sure? 
You usually want to weaken Pokémon some before 
trying to capture them.
 
Sylvana: They’re just Oddish. I have a pretty good chance 
anyway, right? I’m rolling it. First I have to hit them with 
the Poké Ball, right? That’s an AC 6 status attack, and 
I’m in range, so… I rolled an 8 on my Accuracy Roll! 
Does that hit?
GM: Yup. Oddish aren’t very fast. Now roll 1d100 for 
your capture roll. You’re using a basic Poké Ball so you 
don’t add or subtract anything. 
Sylvana rolls a 68 on her capture roll and subtracts her 
Trainer Level, 4, for a total of 64. The GM starts calculating 
the Oddish’s capture rate. He starts with 100, and then 
subtracts twice the Oddish’s level (13x2=26) then another 
25 because the Oddish is above 75% Hit Points, then adds 
another 10 because the Oddish has two evolutions left. 
This nets a final capture rate of 59. Unfortunately Sylvana 
rolled too high to capture the Oddish. 
Hmm…Your Poké Ball hits spot on, but after a few 
shakes, the Oddish bursts out, breaking the ball. It looks 
incensed. Now the Oddish get to go. 
The GM rolls some dice. The Oddish near the bushes 
rolls an 8 to use Poison Powder on Sylvana. The Move 
normally has an AC of 6, but the Oddish is targeting 
through a smokescreen which gives a penalty of 3. The 
Oddish would have needed to roll at least a 10 to hit with 
Sylvana’s Speed Evasion of 1, so the attack misses. Other 
Pokémon would also take a penalty of 2 from targeting 
through Rough Terrain, but Oddish has the Naturewalk 
(Forest, Grassland) Capability and is not hindered by 
the grassy terrain. The other two Oddish huddle and 
target Archie, using Absorb and Poison Powder. They 
roll 10 and 12, both hits. 
GM: Archie’s been Poisoned now. Keep in mind he’s 
going to be down two combat stages in special defense as 
long as he’s poisoned. The other Oddish starts draining 
away Archie’s energy for…
Absorb has a Damage Base of 2, but Oddish are Grass 
Type which means they get STAB or Same Type Attack 
Bonus on this Move. With a Damage Base of 4, the attack 
has a 1d8+6 damage roll plus the user’s Special Attack. 
The GM rolls a 4 on the d8 for a total of 10 damage from 
the Move and 14 more from the Oddish’s Special Attack – 
the final sum is 24 damage. Archie subtracts 4, his Special 
Defense after applying combat stages, from the damage 
and then halves it for resisting Grass Type Moves. He 
takes 10 damage, bringing him down to 50 Hit Points. If 
the Oddish were damaged, it would recover 5 Hit Points 
from the Absorb Move, half the damage it dealt.

Round Two
Sylvana: Okay so it’s my turn again now, right? This isn’t 
too bad so far, but I’m going to have to give Archie an 
Antidote ASAP. First though, let’s have him fry one of 
those Oddish, let’s say, the one in the water. Ember! Oh! 
I rolled a 20. That’s a Critical Hit, right?
Ember has an AC of 2. As she exclaimed, Sylvana rolled a 
20 on her accuracy check, easily overcoming the 2 evasion 
from the Oddish’s Special Defense. It’s a Damage Base 4 
attack, but Archie also gets STAB for using it, raising it to 
DB 6, which has a damage roll of 2d6+8. This is doubled 
by the Critical Hit, making it 4d6+16, and Sylvana rolls a 
[5, 3, 5, 4]. She totals up the damage, adding Archie’s 16 
Special Attack (note that this isn’t doubled by the Critical 
Hit). The attack does 49 damage, subtracting the Oddish’s 
Special Defense of 13 for 36 damage. However, it is then 
multiplied by 1.5 because Fire Type attacks are super-
effective against Grass Types, dealing 54 damage to the 
Oddish. 
GM: Um, ouch! You take out that Oddish in one blow! 
It’s looking pretty crispy now as it Faints. If I were 
keeping track, it’d have three injuries. One from taking 
massive damage – your Ember did over half its Hit 
Points in one hit, and one each from hitting the 50% 
and 0% Hit Point Markers. Don’t forget to make Archie 
take poison damage.
Archie loses a Tick of Hit Points – that’s 6 Hit Points for 
him with his max of 60. He’s now at 44/60 Hit Points. 
Sylvana: Oh…that Critical Hit was kind of a double-
edged sword. Guess I’ll catch another one. For now 
though, I’ll run up to Archie and apply an Antidote to 
him. 
GM: You don’t have Medic Training, so this is going to 
take up Archie’s next action as he stays still to let you 
treat him, alright?

Sylvana: Sure. I just want to keep him from losing too 
many Hit Points from poison.
GM:  The two remaining Oddish close in on you, and 
they spray you and Archie with a fountain of Acid! 
Sylvana: They can hit both of us at once?
GM: Yup. Acid’s a Cone 2 move, which means they can 
hit an area on the map like so. 
The Oddish roll 4 and 14 on their accuracy checks. Lucky 
for Sylvana and Archie, the first Oddish is still in the 
smokescreen, applying a -3 penalty to that Accuracy Roll 
of 4, so that attack misses. The other hits though. Oddish 
also get STAB for Acid, bringing its Damage Base from 4 
to 6. The damage roll is 2d6+8. Rolling [3,3] and adding 
14 Special Attack, the total damage is 28. Sylvana and 
Archie each take 23 damage after subtracting the 5 each 
has in Special Defense. This is enough to bring Archie 
below the 50% Hit Point Marker, so he takes an Injury! 
Archie’s max Hit Points are reduced by 1/10th, becoming 
54, and leaving him at 21/54 Hit Points. Sylvana is left at 
34/57 Hit Points. 
GM: Just calling it an Injury is boring, so let’s actually 
describe how you’re hurt. Archie’s probably a little 
blinded by the spray of acid right now. If we were using 
the optional rules for decreasing combat stages per 
injury, I’d give him a penalty to his accuracy. This is a 
pretty light-hearted campaign though, so we won’t use 
those rules. 
Sylvana: Ouch! Thanks, though this still looks pretty 
bleak for me. Archie won’t get an action next round 
because I used that antidote, and we’re both low enough 
on Hit Points that it looks like the Oddish might be able 
to finish us off… 
Maya: Hey, how about I show up and catch up to Sylvana 
and Archie about now then? It’s suitably dramatic, and 
it’ll keep Sylvana’s first capturing session from turning 
into a horrible experience for her. 
GM: That sounds like a great idea. Putting you in the 
initiative, it’s Archie, then Sylvana, then Maya, then the 
remaining two Oddish.

Round Three
Sylvana: Archie’s skipped, so…I’m going to go up to the 
Oddish near the lake and kick it! 
Sylvana is making a Struggle Attack right now. Struggle 
Attacks are always available to Trainers and Pokémon, 
even if they’ve run out of other Moves to use. Struggle 
Attacks by default have a Damage Base of and AC 
of 4, and the Oddish has 2 physical evasion. Sylvana 
rolls a 6, just barely hitting. The damage roll is 1d8+6. 
Unfortunately, Sylvana rolls badly, only dealing 8 damage 
from the Move plus 8 from her attack stat for a total of 16. 
With the Oddish’s 12 Defense, it only takes 4 damage and 
is hardly hurt at all.
GM: The Oddish giggles like it’s being tickled. You should 
grab some Moves like Strength from Athlete if you want 
to fight yourself, so it shouldn’t be too surprising that 
you weren’t able to do much to the Oddish there. 
Maya:  But I’m a fighter though and through, so this is 
what I live for! I’ll charge onto the scene, straight into 
the smokescreen and heavy brush so I can Aerial Ace 
the Oddish there with a “HYAH!”
Maya is a Martial Artist and a Tumbler, both of which 
are Trainer Classes that have access to Moves. Aerial Ace 
is a Move she learned when she took the Aerialist Feature 
in the Tumbler Class. 
Maya: Hey, I rolled a 1 for my accuracy check! That’s 
just my luck.
GM: That would normally be an automatic miss, but 
Aerial Ace can’t miss. Even bad luck can’t stop you today.
Aerial Ace is a Damage Base 6 Move, with a damage roll 
of 2d6+8. She rolls [5,6] for 19 damage before adding her 
Attack stat of 12. The Oddish subtracts 12 damage for 
its Defense, taking 19 damage which is then multiplied 
by 1.5 for its Flying weakness – final damage is 28. The 
Oddish is left at 25/53 Hit Points and takes two Injuries. 
One for Massive Damage, and one for hitting the 50% Hit 
Point Marker.
GM: The Oddish teeters over from the blow. It’s still 
awake though, and it looks mad! The two Oddish spit 
out more acid all over Sylvana and Maya. 
The GM rolls a 2 for the attack on Maya, missing, but 
a 6 for Sylvana which hits. The attack does 30 damage, 
reduced by 5 by Special Defense, for a final total of 25. 
This leaves Sylvana at a precarious 9 Hit Points! 
Sylvana: Owww! Geez, I fall to my knees, barely able to 
stay awake under the poisonous assault. I guess I better 
end this next round or things are going to be bad, huh?

Round four
Sylvana: Okay, here goes nothing. I’ll have Archie use 
Ember on the Oddish, and then hopefully I’ll be able to 
catch it! 
The GM notices the time and wants to hurry the battle up 
to wrap up the session more quickly. He and the players 
agree to skip rolling for damage and instead use the set 
damage for a given Damage Base instead. Sylvana rolls a 
5 on her Accuracy Roll, which is enough to hit. With STAB 
added in, Ember is a Damage Base 6 attack, which is 15 
damage under the set damage chart. The attack does 31 
damage total, which is reduced by 13 for Special Defense, 
and then multiplied by 1.5 for super effectiveness, for a 
total of 27 damage. The Oddish is brought down to 22 Hit 
Points and has two injuries – one from massive damage 
and one from the 50% Hit Point Marker.
Sylvana: I’ll throw a Poké Ball at it on my turn now! A 
10 should hit it, right? Now for the capture roll…Aw 
man I rolled a 72. Minus 4 makes 68. That’s even worse 
than what I rolled the first time!
GM: Don’t despair just yet. Let me calculate the capture 
rate for the Oddish.
Again, the GM starts at 100 and subtracts the Oddish’s 
level times two. That’s 100 – 26 so far. The Oddish is under 
50% Hit Points, so he leaves that unmodified for now. He 
adds another 10 because Oddish has two evolutions left. 
Each injury the Oddish has also adds 5 to its capture rate 
for a total of 10. The final capture rate for the Pokémon is 
a whopping 94! 
GM: …Yeah, you actually would’ve caught it with pretty 
much any roll. See? It pays to weaken a Pokémon before 
trying to catch it, even if it’s a weak Pokémon to start 
with. 
Maya: You got what you came for, right? I’m gonna 
punch out the last Oddish then!
Maya uses her own Struggle Attack, getting a 9 on her 
Accuracy Roll. With a Damage Base of 4, the attack 
does 11 damage plus her 12 attack for 23 total. With 12 
defense, the Oddish is able to take the blow but is weak.
GM: Well, it could keep fighting, but wild Pokémon 
aren’t stupid. It just saw one of its kind roasted and the 
other captured, so it’s not going to try to stick around 
and fight this out. Either of you two going to try to stop 
it if it tries to scurry away? 
Sylvana: I don’t think I’m in any shape to chase after it.
Maya: It’d be mean to hunt it down and beat it up, 
wouldn’t it? Sylvana got the capture she wanted already.
GM: Great! Now that the wildlife has been, erm, tamed, 
the two of you can enjoy the rest of your afternoon 
relaxing at the lakeside. 
Sylvana: I’m just about to collapse, so I probably really 
need the rest! 
Maya: I bought refreshment items while we were in 
town, so I can get both you and Archie fixed up.
GM: Don’t forget though, Injuries lower max Hit Points, 
so Archie’s maxed out at 54 Hit Points. We’ll wrap up as 
soon as I calculate experience points for the encounter. 
Sylvana automatically gains one trainer experience for 
catching a new Pokémon species. The GM then totals up 
the levels of the Oddish fought, getting 39. Even though 
the last  Oddish ran away, the GM decides to count it as 
defeated because the players could have easily knocked it 
out if they wanted to – and he doesn’t want to encourage 
players to brutally hunt down wild Pokémon just for 
Experience in the future. The GM decides this was an 
everyday encounter, with a significance multiplier of 1. 
This is divided by two, giving each player 19 Experience 
for their Pokémon. Even though Maya arrived late and 
didn’t use a Pokémon, the GM decides to reward her 
with a portion of the Experience to allocate to any of 
her Pokémon in order to keep things even. With a new 
Pokémon for Sylvana and Experience for both Trainers’ 
Pokémon, Sylvana’s charging in by herself against all 
those Oddish seems to have paid off this time, at least.
