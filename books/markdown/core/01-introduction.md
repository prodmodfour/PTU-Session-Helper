Chapter 1: 
Introduction
Welcome to Pokémon Tabletop United, a pen and paper 
roleplaying game where players play the role of trainers 
in the world of Pokémon. It is best played with a group 
of 2-4 players creating Player Characters, or PCs, to act 
as their avatars in a game world created by their Game 
Master, or GM. We’re going to presume if you’ve found 
us that you’re probably familiar with most tabletop 
roleplaying terminology or have at your disposal 
someone who can quickly explain the basics to you!
Pokémon Tabletop United is designed to handle a 
variety of different ideas for Pokémon tabletop RPG 
campaigns. You can use the system for a traditional 
game where the players take the role of young Trainers 
receiving their first Pokémon from a Professor as they 
prepare to leave town for the first time and conquer the 
Pokémon League. Or you could play a campaign about 
Pokémon in Space or a Wild West frontier exploration 
game. 
This book will provide you with all the core rules you 
need to play, but it is also packaged with sourcebooks 
that help you put together less traditional Pokémon 
campaigns. As you might have guessed already, Trainers 
play a much more active role in Pokémon Tabletop 
United than they do in the video games, from giving 
orders and dictating battle strategy on the fly to actually 
fighting alongside their Pokémon. 
Don’t let that last bit scare you though! If you’re wanting 
to play a lighthearted game where Trainers always cheer 
on their Pokémon from the sidelines and Team Rocket 
goes home after they get beaten in a Pokémon battle, 
that’s totally doable! 
The options for making Trainers in Pokémon Tabletop 
United are largely sorted into Classes, much like many 
other roleplaying games. It’s easy to pick and choose 
what to allow in a particular campaign to get the type 
of game you want. That said, all of the Classes presented 
in this core document are representative of concepts 
that have appeared in some mainline Pokémon media, 
whether it be the anime, the manga, or the video games. 
Even if you’re skeptical of Trainers taking a more 
active role in their adventures with their Pokémon, 
we recommend giving it a shot. You can skip ahead to 
Chapter 3 of this book and skim through the descriptions 
of the Trainer Classes to get a feel for what kind of game 
system this is. 
We’ve striven to make a system where most Pokémon are 
useful in Pokémon Tabletop United. The game balance 
and what works is quite different from the video games, 
and you’ll find a lot of new strategies that are made 
possible with the rules in Pokémon Tabletop United. 
We encourage you to try new things and innovate!

What do I Need to Play?
Pokémon Tabletop United runs the gamut of tabletop 
roleplaying game dice. You’ll use a number of d6s for 
most common Skill checks, d20s for accuracy rolls in 
combat, and a variety of other dice for rolling damage 
in combat, from d4s to d12s. 
This system provides rules for combat on a grid, though 
it isn’t necessary to play the game. Distances can be 
abstracted, but the option is there if you prefer gaming 
with a mat and minis. 
Make sure you have the Pokédex PDF document as well. 
It should be packaged along with this book in the .zip 
file you downloaded. On the off chance you managed 
to find this book as a standalone PDF, simply check the 
forums listed in the contacts section on the credits page 
or ask around in the listed IRC channel.
PTU and PTA?
As you may or may not be aware, Pokémon Tabletop 
United is a parallel successor or “sister system” to 
Pokémon Tabletop Adventures. For those of you 
familiar with PTA, you’ll find that many character 
options in PTU are similar. However, the games differ a 
lot in structure and mechanics. 
Trainers and Pokémon share the same set of Combat 
Stats in Pokémon Tabletop United, which means they’re 
able to benefit from Combat Stages and be affected by 
Moves and Abilities that affect them or that rely upon 
manipulating Stat values. 
Unlike PTA, there is no Attribute system in PTU. 
Everything is done via Skills.
The Base Class/Advanced Class structure is gone, 
making the “cross-classing” options from PTA the 
norm rather than a special exception and allowing more 
flexibility in building Trainers. 
And finally, the biggest change in PTU is that there’s a 
Skill system which smoothens out interactions between 
Trainers and Pokémon and makes it easier to adjudicate 
common adventuring tasks and create characters with 
developed specializations and interests.
What’s in the Book? 
Chapter 2: Character Creation walks you through how 
to make a character in Pokémon Tabletop United.
Chapter 3: Skill, Edges, and Features details some of 
the basic components of a Trainer character. 
Chapter 4: Trainer Classes provides you with your 
Class options – the bulk of your character building. In 
addition, there’s a list of common Pokémon character 
archetypes and how to build them in this system.
Chapter 5: Pokémon is, of course, about the Pokémon. 
Everything you need to know to stat up your team is 
here, along with rules for common Pokémon activities 
like fishing, breeding, and searching for fossils. 
Chapter 6: Playing the Game outlines the gameplay 
mechanics of Pokémon Tabletop United. You’ll also 
find some player tips here to help you get going on the 
roleplaying side of things.
Chapter 7: Combat has all the rules you’ll need for 
exciting Pokémon battles! There’s also a combat demo 
to give you an example of what a battle should look like. 
Chapter 8: Pokémon Contests gives rules for running 
these Pokémon performances and competitions known 
as Pokémon Contests. And of course, there’s a demo 
showing how a Contest runs.
Chapter 9: Gear and Items lists the various items you’ll 
run across while playing the game, from berries that 
you harvest in the wild to equipment for your character 
to the Poké Balls you need for capturing Pokémon. 
Chapter 10: Indices and Reference is your one-stop 
resource for looking up how to use all those traits your 
Pokémon have, such as their Capabilities, Abilities 
and Moves. There’s also a glossary of terms used in the 
system for easy reference.
Chapter 11: Running the Game is the GM’s resource. 
It provides tips ranging from how to create a campaign 
world to making encounters and distributing EXP. A 
thorough encounter creation guide in this chapter will 
help ease new GMs into the task of putting together 
exciting and dynamic battles for their players.

Supplement Books/Material
Hopefully, when you downloaded this document, it 
came with all the supplements we made for the system 
as well. If not, then as with the Pokédex, you can check 
out our forums or contact us through our IRC channel 
to get a copy of them. 
First of all, you’ll find character sheets in the .zip file 
for your use as well as standalone PDFs for some of the 
more useful charts in the book, such as the Pokémon 
Experience Chart and the Damage Base Chart.
Secondly, you’ll see we’ve made a few supplement 
sourcebooks for running campaigns in varied genres. 
We consider PTU to be a versatile toolkit capable of 
running a variety of adventures in the default Pokémon 
setting. However, many players and GMs want to go 
beyond that, and that’s what our supplements are for.
The Blessed and the Damned is a supplement dealing 
with Legendary Pokémon and their treatment as divine 
entities. Different Pokémon media each take different 
approaches to Legendary Pokémon, and while we prefer 
a more restrained and conservative approach for the 
core book, we also wanted to leave the option open for 
those who want to portray much more powerful and 
god-like Legendary Pokémon.
In addition to information on putting together a 
pantheon of Legendary Pokémon for a setting, the 
book contains rules for Trainers to be given blessings 
by Legendary Pokémon or to seek their power in 
other ways. These take the form of templates similar to 
Trainer Classes called the Touched, Signers, Branded, 
Messiahs, and Usurpers. Veterans of PTA who glance 
through PTU and wonder where all the Legendary-
associated Trainer Classes went can find similar options 
in this supplement. 
Do Porygon Dream of Mareep? is PTU’s science fiction 
supplement, and it offers rules for many situations that 
don’t come up in normal PTU play, such as dealing with 
the vacuum of space and varying gravity levels. While 
the core PTU rules generally don’t do much to explore or 
question the origins of the advanced technology in the 
Pokémon Universe, such as Poké Balls and the storage 
system, this supplement gives ideas for establishing the 
nature of these technologies in a campaign setting.  
Finally, there are new Trainer options for high tech 
campaigns. First, the Researcher Fields: Engineer com-
mands Pokémon-like robots, Upgrader deals in cyber-
netic augmentations, Jailbreaker modifies Poké Balls. 
Second, the Glitch Trainer Class harnesses the reality 
warping power behind entities such as MissingNo. 
Game of Throhs is a fantasy supplement that further 
explores the supernatural elements in Pokémon as well 
as the use of weapons and armor. While the Pokémon 
Universe has always included many supernatural 
elements even among humans, such as those with 
psychic powers or the ability to read others’ Auras, the 
core book does not delve particularly deeply into these 
aspects of the universe. More detailed treatments of 
these topics can be found in this supplement instead. 
This, of course, includes a number of Trainer Classes. 
Those who’ve seen older iterations of our system 
might note some omissions in this core release. The 
Rune Master dealing with the Unown are now in this 
supplement, and the old Elementalist has been split 
up into many Classes, each representing a single Type 
and the powers humans can gain related to that Type. 
Finally, commensurate with this supplement’s more in-
depth treatment of weapons and armor, there is are four 
Weapon Specialist Classes and a Berserker too.
Finally, each of these supplements includes plenty of 
fluff, lore, and even sample settings to help GMs put 
together campaigns in their respective genres. 
If this seems a tad overwhelming, don’t worry! None 
of the supplements are necessary to enjoy this game. 
GMs who wish to stay true to the source material can 
confidently use the core book only, and those who wish 
to try something new can look in the supplements.
You’ll occasionally see boxes like this where we’ll 
clarify rules and give examples and pointers. Please 
stop by http://forums.Pokémontabletop.com/index/ 
and go to the Pokémon Tabletop United section to give 
us feedback. This is a hobbyist-made game, and we’re 
always looking to improve. So feel free to share your 
experiences and opinions. 
The next section is a quick primer on the Pokémon 
universe for those new to the franchise. If you’re a 
Pokémon veteran already, then you should read on to 
Chapter 2: Character Creation. Making a character is 
the best way to begin learning the game system. Enjoy!

What is Pokémon?
Welcome to the world of Pokémon! Pokémon is a 
popular franchise spanning many video games, an 
anime series, and several manga series. The central 
concept of the franchise is the existence of fantastical 
monsters called Pokémon. All wildlife takes the form 
of Pokémon, which can be anything from animals with 
elemental powers, animated plants, inorganic objects, 
or even ghosts and spirits. 
Each Pokémon embodies one or two elemental Types, 
which range from traditional elements such as Fire and 
Water to more esoteric ones such as Ghost and Psychic 
or even animal types like Dragon and Bug. These Types 
have weaknesses to certain other types and are strong 
against others. These strengths and weaknesses are an 
important part of the Pokémon world. 
Additionally, most Pokémon can Evolve. This refers not 
to the slow process of change over generations but a 
quick metamorphosis in which a Pokémon turns into 
energy and changes into a new form. Evolution can 
be triggered by many methods, ranging from simply 
gaining experience in battle to using Elemental Stones 
or other rare items. 
Pokémon Trainers
People known as Pokémon Trainers capture Pokémon 
in small spherical devices called Poké Balls that can 
turn them into energy and store them in stasis. Many 
Trainers simply collect Pokémon, whether as a hobby or 
for research, but the most popular use of Pokémon is to 
battle them for sport. 
This might sound horribly similar to underground dog 
fighting, but that couldn’t be further from the truth in 
Pokémon. It’s an established principle of the setting in 
the Pokémon universe that Pokémon almost universally 
enjoy battling and have evolved to be skillful fighters. 
Trainers develop strong bonds of friendship with the 
Pokémon they raise to fight for them, and Pokémon 
battling is a widely televised sport around which much 
of the world’s economy revolves. 
Many technologies are at least partially replaced 
by Pokémon. Electric Types may be used to power 
generators, Pokémon are often ridden in lieu of using 
vehicles, and even tasks like construction are made 
easier with the aid of Pokémon. 
The Pokémon League
Pokémon battling is governed by an organization 
known as the Pokémon League which sets regulations 
for Trainers. Beginning Trainers usually receive their 
first Pokémon at a young age from a Pokémon Professor, 
a researcher who’s been put in charge of getting new 
Trainers started. They also often are given a device 
called a Pokédex which is like a smartphone with a 
digital encyclopedia on all the known Pokémon species. 
Trainers often battle each other for fun or for small 
wagers as they journey, catching new Pokémon in the 
wilds and training their team as they go. Rivalries are 
an important part of the Pokémon franchise; childhood 
friends or siblings may battle each other many times 
over the course of their Pokémon adventures, testing 
each other and improving together. 
Many institutions exist to support and encourage 
Trainers as they travel. Pokémon Centers are medical 
facilities that offer free treatment to Trainers’ injured 
Pokémon, and most shops in town carry a variety of 
Trainer-centric items, from the all-important Poké Balls 
to medicines and vitamins for Pokémon or advanced 
machines that can teach them new battle moves. 
Trainers who seek out non-violent ways to train and 
show off their Pokémon often compete in Pokémon 
Contests, which are performance acts much like dance 
or musical competitions for people. 
The Pokémon League sets up a structure of Pokémon 
Gyms in the cities of a region or country which act as 
benchmarks for Pokémon Trainers. These Gyms are 
run by Gym Leaders who usually specialize in a single 
Pokémon Type, making it important for Trainers to 
learn the strengths and weaknesses of each Type in 
order to improve and grow. Trainers who defeat a Gym 
Leader earn their Gym Badge.
Upon earning a certain number of Gym Badges, usually 
eight, a Trainer qualifies to take on the Pokémon League 
Tournament, which is an annual event that pits all 
qualified Trainers against each other for pride and glory. 
The winner, or sometimes the top few participants, win 
the right to challenge the Elite 4, a set of truly masterful 
Pokémon Trainers who embody the best the Pokémon 
League has to show. The champion of this tournament 
wins a lot of fame and recognition, not just within the 
Pokémon League but within society as a whole.

Post-League Challenges
Where do champions of a region’s Pokémon League 
or other top-ranking Trainers go after they’ve reached 
their peak in their home region? 
Many of them simply take on the Pokémon League 
challenge in other regions, traveling all around the world 
in pursuit of new experiences, exotic new Pokémon to 
capture, and stronger Trainers to battle against. 
Alternatively, some regions have parks called Battle 
Frontiers specifically to cater to these elite Trainers. 
Oftentimes, Battle Frontiers are privately sponsored 
rather than part of the Pokémon League, though they are 
usually recognized by the League regardless. In practice, 
they are similar to a cluster of Pokémon Gyms, though 
the challenges within are much more challenging and 
often more involved than battles against Gym Leaders. 
Frontier Brains are the equivalent of Gym Leaders in 
the facilities in a Battle Frontier. While Gym Leaders 
and even Elite 4 members often align themselves with 
a particular Type of Pokémon, even if only for the 
purpose of their challenge, the Frontier Brains tend to 
use much more varied teams that require more complex 
strategies to take on. Not only that, but they also tend to 
have multiple tiers of challenges and reward successful 
challengers with medals, prints, symbols, or other 
Badge equivalents that come in Silver and Gold varieties 
depending on the tier of the challenge completed.
Highly accomplished Trainers may move away from 
competitive battling entirely and dedicate their lives 
to other endeavors, or at least take a break. Some will 
seek out Legendary Pokémon, incredibly rare species of 
Pokémon that appear in mythological tales. Others will 
commit themselves to Pokémon research or competing 
in Contests. It is also not uncommon for Trainers to 
never challenge the League and dedicate their lives to 
these activities from the start of their journeys.  
Law and Order in the Pokémon World
Just as many technologies and institutions are built 
around Pokémon, much criminal activity centers 
around the creatures as well. Poaching, outright theft, 
and abuse of Pokémon are common crimes in the 
Pokémon universe and are the focus of law enforcement. 
Traditionally, in the Pokémon franchise, each major 
region in the Pokémon universe houses a large criminal 
organization that names itself as a Team.
Team Rocket is simply a criminal syndicate seeking 
to steal and exploit Pokémon for money and power, 
and their modus operandi is to infiltrate the Pokémon 
League itself and plant high ranking executives as Gym 
Leaders or members of the Elite 4. Team Magma and 
Team Aqua on the other hand are ideologically oriented 
criminal organizations that seek out the power of 
Legendary Pokémon to expand the land or oceans of 
the world respectively. 
Criminal Teams tend to be flashy and have iconic 
uniforms in the Pokémon world, and they are the 
center of organized crime. Fighting against them are 
the International Police or Pokémon Rangers associated 
with a given region. While the former fight organized 
crime, the latter focus on Pokémon poaching, crimes in 
the wilderness, and other activities more suited to being 
dealt with by a local force. Pokémon Rangers also have 
the task of patrolling the wilderness for Trainers who 
have run into trouble during their travels and lending 
a helping hand. They must be familiar with the wilds 
in their jurisdiction and be on good terms with local 
Pokémon populations. 
Supernatural Elements in Pokémon
Pokémon themselves are magical creatures, of course, 
but there are certain supernatural elements in the 
Pokémon world that warrant a specific note.
Psionic powers are the most common of supernatural 
powers that can be associated with Trainers and not just 
Pokémon. They range from telepathy to telekinesis and 
are usually inborn traits.
Aura is the spiritual energy in all living things in the 
Pokémon franchise. Particular Pokémon and Trainers 
can perceive or manipulate Aura, which lets them peer 
into the emotions of others or perform supernatural 
feats. It can be considered similar to the concept of Chi 
and is closely associated with the Fighting Type. 
Ghost Type Pokémon are not given much of an 
explanation in the main franchise, and we don’t take a 
stance on their nature in PTU either. Simply put, they 
may be impressions left by the memories of the departed, 
the literal souls of the dead, or simply creatures closely 
associated with death. It’s up to the GM. 
Finally, the Pokémon world is filled with ancient ruins 
that may house relics of civilizations past, Legendary 
Pokémon, or magical artifacts with fantastical effects.
