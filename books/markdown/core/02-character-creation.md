Chapter 2:  
Character Creation
Making Trainers
Before you can begin playing Pokémon Tabletop United, 
you first need to create your Trainer character who 
will be your alter ego in the world of Pokémon. Your 
character will be the focus of the game and the exciting 
adventures you have, so making the right character for 
yourself and for the game campaign is very important!
As you first read this chapter, you may come across 
some terms and rules you don’t immediately under-
stand. Don’t worry! We’ll be explaining everything you 
need to know, and you’ll see green boxes showing a step 
by step example of character creation. 
There are a lot of options when it comes to building your 
character, but at the beginning of this chapter, we want 
to focus on the step by step process, so you’ll see page 
references and hyperlinks laid out wherever you would 
turn to another part of the book to choose options for 
creating your very own Pokémon Trainer.
Before you begin, you’ll want a blank character sheet to 
fill out. You can find one in the back of this book or as a 
standalone pdf in the .zip file for this system! 
Now you’re ready to start writing your character!
Step 1: Character Concept
You may be tempted to jump into crunching numbers 
immediately, especially if you’re an experienced role-
player. Don’t! Or at least take just a skim through to 
get an idea of what’s available before coming back and 
thinking about who you want your Trainer to be.
It’s important at this step to talk to the other players 
and the GM about what kind of campaign you will be 
playing and what character types the GM is looking for. 
You may be faithfully following the anime and manga 
and all play kids setting out on their first Pokémon 
adventure, or your GM might have in mind something 
more specific, such as playing rookies in a detective 
agency under the command of Looker or even as grunts 
of Team Rocket. You only need a brief idea for now, and 
you can expand on it later!
Example: Lisa is sitting down for her first game of 
Pokémon Tabletop United, so she’s creating a character. 
The GM has told the players they’ll all be teenage Trainers 
leaving their hometown for the first time, and they’ll be 
receiving their first Pokémon as the game starts. She 
decides on an energetic girl who’s the daughter of the 
Poké Ball crafter in town. She’s passionate and eager to 
put her family’s Poké Balls to use, but she’s a little naive 
about the dangers of the world.

Step 2: Create Background
A Background is a brief phrase describing your 
character’s life experiences and helps determine your 
Trainer’s starting Skill Ranks. Depending on how your 
Trainer got to where they are today, they will have 
acquired different Skills and neglected others. 
Skills represent conscious interest and training that 
your character uses to interact with the world, as well as 
incorporating a Trainer’s natural talent. Skills are used 
for the most basic interactions between yourself and the 
game world, and they help determine what Classes and 
Features your  Trainer qualifies for. You may want to 
read up on the Skills in Pokémon Tabletop United (page 
33) before continuing with writing a Background and 
the next step in character creation.  
This is the step where you start taking your Character 
Concept and fleshing it out a little. Hone in on what 
your Trainer would have picked up and learned, either 
from necessity or by their own interests, as they grew 
up. And then think about what their weaknesses might 
have been and what sorts of developed skills they would 
have neglected in that time. Have fun with this process! 
Remember, you’re determining the baseline from which 
your Trainer will grow and develop, and you should 
make sure it is something you’re completely happy with.
All Skills except for those modified by your Background 
begin at the Untrained Rank before Edges and Features 
are chosen, so your choices here will have a huge impact 
on your character.
A list of example Backgrounds can be found on the 
following page, but you may simply choose to make 
up your own, with the approval of the GM, of course. 
Simply choose 1 Skill to raise to Adept Rank and 1 Skill 
to raise to Novice Rank. Then choose 3 Skills to lower one 
Rank, down to Pathetic. These Pathetic Skills cannot be 
raised above Pathetic during character creation. Be sure 
to give an evocative name to your custom Background!
Example: Lisa thinks her character spends a lot of 
time playing outside and running around, so she wants 
a Background that will raise her Athletics Skill. Not 
wanting to get too complicated, she decides to look 
over the sample Backgrounds. Fitness Training raises 
Athletics and Acrobatics, which is a perfect fit. Even 
better, it lowers Guile, Intuition, and Focus, which Lisa 
thinks is perfect to represent her character’s naiveté.
Step 3: Choose Edges
Edges are used to represent a character’s training and 
development in the broad fields covered by this game’s 
Skills. The most basic type of Edge is a Skill Edge which 
simply raises the Rank of one their Skills by one. Keep 
in mind you cannot raise Skills above Novice at your 
starting level!
However, there are also other Edges which represent 
more specific training within the area of a single 
Skill, such as training to be a better Swimmer within 
the Athletics Skill or learning to better prepare your 
Pokémon for Contests within the Charm Skill. 
Starting Trainers begin with four Edges to distribute 
as they see fit. 
Example: Lisa decides that her Trainer is a natural 
leader and spends one of her starting Edges on bringing 
her Command Skill up to Novice. She also figures that 
with a family working in the Poké Ball business, her 
Trainer would be at least passingly familiar with the 
process for making them. Figuring that her Trainer 
wouldn’t be interested in the mechanical processes for 
building modern Poké Balls, Lisa spends one Edge to 
raise Survival up to Novice, one to focus in the area of 
Apricorns by taking Apricorn Balls, and one to take the 
Swimmer Edge.
Step 4: Choose Features
Features are what really make a Trainer stand out and 
provide most of their definition and functionality in the 
game. There are a number of General Features available 
to all Trainers in Pokémon Tabletop United, but most 
Features are tied to Trainer Classes.   
Classes are special Features that act as gateways to 
groupings of related Features that are strongly tied 
to a particular concept. If you’re familiar with other 
RPGs, even if not tabletop RPGs, you probably know 
of the common set of the Warrior, the Rogue, and the 
Wizard as character classes. The same idea applies here, 
but you’ll be finding Classes such as the Ace Trainer, 
the Coordinator, and the Capture Specialist which are 
much more tied to the concepts of Pokémon.
Starting Trainers begin with four Features to 
distribute as they see fit. They also choose one 
Training Feature to gain, regardless of prerequisites. 


## Page 14

Character Creation
14
Most players will find it most useful to spend all or a 
majority of their starting Features on Features in a Class 
when possible, so as to best define their Trainers at the 
beginning of the game. 
While it is technically possible to take three or four 
different Classes as a starting Trainer, doing so will 
stretch you very thin with the Skill prerequisites for 
those Classes and can dilute your Character Concept. 
Consider starting with just one or two Classes and 
developing within them and perhaps a General Feature. 
You can take Steps 3 and 4 in any order, alternating 
between spending Edges and Features as best suits 
you.
Example: Lisa decides that although her Trainer’s 
parents develop Poké Balls, she herself hasn’t spent 
dedicated time to learning how to capture Pokémon 
with great skill. It’s a good thing too, because she looks 
at the requirements for Capture Specialist and sees that 
she would have to redo her starting Edges in order to 
qualify anyway. Instead, Lisa focuses on the energetic 
and competitive nature of her Trainer and gives her the 
Agility Training Feature as her free Training Feature. 
For her four Features, she starts with the Ace Trainer 
Class and its Perseverance Feature. She then eyes some 
of the Features further into the Class but decides that 
she needs to better reflect her character’s active nature 
and goes with taking the Athlete Class instead. With 
one Feature remaining, Lisa chooses Training Regime. 
Both Athlete and Training Regime have [+HP] tags, so 
she keeps that in mind for later.

Step 5: Assign Combat Stats
Pokémon Tabletop United uses the same 6 Combat 
Stats used in the Pokémon video games. If you’re 
familiar with the video games, then these will need no 
introduction. If not, read on for an explanation!
The 6 combat stats are HP, Attack, Defense, Special 
Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. 
HP determines your Hit Points, which represent your 
ability to take hits and keep going in battle. 
Attack represents how hard you can hit Physically, and 
it is added to the damage roll of all Physical Damage a 
Trainer or Pokémon deals. 
Defense is used to avoid and resist Physical attacks. 
Whenever a Trainer or Pokémon takes Physical damage, 
they subtract their Defense stat from the damage first 
before subtracting damage from their Hit Points. 
Additionally, for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer 
has in Defense, they gain +1 Physical Evasion, up to a 
maximum of +6 at 30 Defense.
Special Attack represents how hard you can hit with 
Special attacks, and it is added to the damage roll of all 
Special Damage a Trainer or Pokémon deals.
Special Defense is used to avoid and resist Special 
attacks. Whenever a Trainer or Pokémon takes Special 
damage, they subtract their Special Defense stat from 
the damage first before subtracting damage from their 
Hit Points. 
Additionally, for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer 
has in Special Defense, they gain +1 Special Evasion, 
up to a maximum of +6 at 30 Special Defense.
Speed is a measure of how quick a Trainer or Pokémon 
is and determines turn order in combat. Additionally 
for every 5 points a Pokémon or Trainer has in Speed, 
they gain +1 Speed Evasion, up to a maximum of +6 at 
30 Speed.
Starting Trainers begin with 10 HP and 5 points each 
in the rest of their Combat Stats. You may distribute 
10 additional points among your Combat Stats, but 
no more than 5 points into any single stat.
Example: Lisa decides her Trainer is quick in battle and assigns her Combat Stats as so: 13 HP, 7 Attack, 5 Defense, 
5 Special Attack, 5 Special Defense, 10 Speed. With the two [+HP] tags from before, her final HP is 15. 
Tip: HP is very important, both for Pokémon and for Trainers! Even if you’re making a “glass cannon” build, you 
can’t neglect HP too much or you’ll be sorry! Seriously. You’ll be miserable if you do.

Step 6: Find Derived Stats
Your Skills, Combat Stats, and more feed into a number 
of other stats that are used in Combat as well as 
Capabilities that determine how much your character 
can lift, how fast they can move, and more. For more 
details on how Capabilities are used in playing the 
game, see the section on Capabilities on page 222. 
Action Points, or AP, are a resource Trainers use to 
power their Features. Trainers have 5 AP plus 1 more 
for every 5 Trainer Levels. A Level 10 Trainer has 7 AP, 
for example. AP refreshes at the start of each Scene. See 
the Playing the Game chapter for more (page 221).
Hit Points determine how much punishment you can 
take in battle. If a Pokémon or Trainer ever reaches 0 
Hit Points, they are unable to take any actions and are 
unconscious. Hit Points are derived from HP and are 
calculated differently for Pokémon and for Trainers. See 
page 198 for Pokémon Hit Points. 
Trainer Hit Points = Trainer’s Level x 2 + (HP x 3) +10
Evasion helps Trainers and Pokémon avoid attacks. 
There are three types of Evasion: Physical Evasion, 
Special Evasion, and Speed Evasion. To calculate these 
Evasion values, divide the related Combat Stat by 5 and 
round down. You may never have more than +6 in a 
given Evasion from Combat Stats alone. 
These derived stats and their uses will be described in 
further detail in the Combat chapter (page 226). 
Power is measure of raw physical strength and ability 
to lift heavy objects. A Trainer’s Power starts at 4 but is 
changed by several factors. 
»»
If your Athletics Skills is at Novice Rank or higher, 
increase Power by +1.
»»
If your Combat Skill is at Adept Rank or higher, 
increase Power by +1
High Jump determines how high a Trainer or Pokémon 
can jump in meters. A Trainer’s High Jump starts at 0, 
but is raised by several factors. 
»»
If your Acrobatics is Adept, raise High Jump by +1. 
»»
If your Acrobatics is Master, raise High Jump by an 
additional +1. 
»»
If you have a running start when jumping, raise 
High Jump by +1. 
Note that a High Jump of 0 doesn’t mean you can’t jump; 
it just means you have to make a Skill Check to deter-
mine how high you can jump and whether you breach 
1 meter. 
Long Jump is how much horizontal distance a Trainer 
or Pokémon can jump in meters. This value for Trainers 
is equal to half of their Acrobatics Rank.
Overland Movement Speed is how quickly a Trainer 
or Pokémon can move over flat land. For Trainers, this 
value is equal to three plus half the sum of their Athletics 
and Acrobatics Ranks. By default, this value is 5. 
Overland = 3 + [(Athl + Acro)/2]
Swimming Speed for a Trainer is equal to half of their 
Overland Speed. 
Features and other bonuses that grant general boosts 
to Movement Speed only grant it to Movement Speeds 
which you already have; giving a Trainer a +4 bonus to 
all of their Movement Speeds does not suddenly grant 
them flight. However, Features and Abilities that grant 
specific movement boosts do. A Feature that grants +4 
Levitate Speed causes that trainer to have a Levitate 
Speed of 4, if they did not already have a Levitate Speed.
Throwing Range is how far a Trainer can throw Poké 
Balls and other items. It’s equal to 4 plus Athletics Rank. 
Size is how big you are. Trainers are Medium by default. 
Your Trainer’s weight matters too. A Trainer between 
55 and 110 pounds is Weight Class 3. Between 111 and 
220 is WC 4. Higher than that is WC 5. 
Example: As a level 1 Trainer, Lisa’s character has 57 Hit Points 1 Physical Evasion, 1 Special Evasion, and 2 Speed 
Evasion. Her Capabilities are Power 5, High Jump 0, Long Jump 1, Overland 6, Swim 3, and Throwing Range 8. She 
is Medium Size and weighs 120 pounds and therefore is Weight Class 4.

Step 7: Basic Descriptions
Your character is now mostly complete as far as the game 
mechanics go, but that’s only the start. Now’s the time 
when you should take care to flesh out your character’s 
appearance, their personality, and anything else that 
isn’t covered by the game mechanics but is important to 
defining a person. Choose a name! You’ll be using it for 
the rest of the campaign, so be sure you’re happy with 
whatever you choose. 
At this point, you may want to talk to your GM and the 
other players about developing a more detailed history 
for your character. This is optional and doesn’t need to 
happen in every campaign. It’s perfectly okay to gloss 
over childhoods and focus on the adventure to come, 
but in some campaign types, it’s important to estab-
lish where a character comes from, such as a detective’s 
brush with death at the hands of some thugs as a child 
or a Team Rocket member’s difficult childhood growing 
up in the slums with a single parent. 
It can be fun to talk to the other players and develop 
a sort of loose interconnectedness or shared history 
between your Trainers. Maybe you all went to the same 
Pokémon Trainers’ school or were even in the same 
homeroom. Some GMs may require that you establish 
these connections between characters before the game 
starts, while others will want you to develop your 
relationships organically through playing the game. 
Example: Lisa chooses the name Sylvana for her Trainer 
and then talks to Kate and Brian, the other players in 
her game, to discuss their characters’ histories. Kate is 
playing Maya, a level-headed Martial Artist, who they 
decide has been best friends with Sylvana since they 
were kids. Brian is playing Viktor, a Mentor whose 
family just moved to town and was welcomed warmly 
by both Sylvana and Maya’s families. The three of them 
and the GM decide that establishing this level of loose 
connection is enough, and they don’t need to go into too 
much further detail. He does ask for a little more detail 
on each of their families and about their classmates 
though and files that information away for later to use 
for making rival NPCs and character-driven plotlines 
for the game. 
Step 8: Choose Pokémon
Even if you begin the campaign with Trainers receiving 
their first Pokémon, it’s a good practice to have the 
players pick those Pokémon before the game starts to 
allow them to stat up the Pokémon and learn how they 
work. See the chapter on Pokémon (page 196) for how 
to stat and manage your Pokémon.
While it’s up to the GM to decide how many Pokémon 
and what kinds of Pokémon the players start with, it’s 
recommended for level 1 Trainers to begin with a single 
level 5 or level 10 Pokémon, chosen from either the 
Starter Pokémon in the video games or any relatively 
common species of Pokémon with three evolutionary 
stages. The chapter on Running the Game (page 437) 
provides more tips on choosing starting Pokémon. 
Example: While the GM in Lisa’s game is having all 
the characters receive their first Pokémon at the start 
of the game, he’s decided not to restrict them to the 
canonical starters. Despite this, Lisa chooses Cyndaquil 
for Sylvana’s first Pokémon. Kate chooses a Machop for 
Maya, and Brian has Viktor begin with a Swinub. 
Step 9: Money and Items
Pokémon Trainers need to do a lot of packing for their 
journeys, from basic supplies like Potions and Poké 
Balls to more specialized equipment like Fishing Rods 
and Poffin Mixers. 
While it is ultimately up to your GM how much money 
Trainers start with in their campaigns and what items 
are available for purchase, we recommend all starting 
Trainers begin with a Pokédex and $5000 to split 
between spending on supplies and keeping as cash.
Example: Lisa’s GM gives each player $5000 to buy 
items for their character, in addition to the standard 
Pokédex. Lisa decides to spend $1500 on buying 6 Basic 
Balls, $600 on 3 Potions, and $200 each on an Antidote 
and a Paralyze Heal. She then realizes she needs a Poké 
Ball Tool Kit to use her Apricorn Balls Edge, which she 
buys for $500. This leaves her with $2000 cash on hand.
And that’s it! Enjoy playing Pokémon Tabletop United!

Step 1: Create Character Concept. Ask your GM what kind of campaign they are running and if they have 
any expectations about the sorts of characters that will be played. Come up with a short phrase describing your 
character concept. 
Step 2: Create Skill Background. Rank three different Skills down to Pathetic Rank. Rank up one Skill to Adept 
Rank and one other Skill to Novice Rank. Give a short name to your background. 
Step 3: Choose Edges. You gain four Edges to distribute. Remember, even though you have one Adept Skill after 
creating your Background, you cannot use Edges to raise other Skills up to Adept until you are at least Level 2. You 
also may not use Edges to Rank Up any of the Skills you lowered to Pathetic Rank. 
Step 4: Choose Features. You gain four Features to distribute and additionally pick one Training Feature for free. 
You do not need to meet prerequisites for the Training Feature you chose. 
You may do Steps 3 and 4 in any order, alternating between them to qualify for Edges and Features. 
Step 5: Assign Combat Stats. Level 1 Trainers begin with 10 HP and 5 in each of their other Stats. You then assign 
10 points as you wish among the Stats, putting no more than 5 points in any single Stat. Don’t forget that some 
Features have Stat Tags to apply! 
Step 6: Find Derived Stats. 
Character Creation Quick-Start Steps
Trainers begin with 5 Action Points and gain 1 more 
AP for every 5 Trainer Levels they have. 
Trainers have Hit Points equal to (Trainer Level x2) + 
(HP x3) + 10.
Power starts at 4. If Athletics is at least Novice, raise 
Power by +1. If Combat is at least Adept, raise Power 
by +1. 
High Jump starts at 0. If Acrobatics is at least Adept, 
raise High Jump by+1. If Acrobatics is Master, raise 
High Jump by an additional +1. 
Long Jump is equal to Acrobtics/2. 
Overland is equal to 3 + [(Athl + Acro)/2].
Swim is equal to Overland/2. 
Throwing Range is 4 + Athletics Rank. 
Size is Medium. 
Weight Class is 3 if you are between 55 and 110 pounds, 
4 if you are between 111 and 220 pounds, and 5 if higher 
than that. 
Step 7: Create Basic Descriptions. Come up with what your character looks like and a background for them. The 
GM will tell you how much detail you need to put into this step. Be sure to have fun working and discussing with 
the other players as you take this step!
Step 8: Choose your Starter Pokémon. The GM will tell you their guidelines for choosing a Starter Pokémon. 
Read on to Chapter 5: Pokémon for details on how to stat and keep track of Pokémon. 
Step 9: Buy starting items. Most campaigns starting at Level 1 should start Trainers with $5000 to split between 
starting equipment and reserve cash. It’s recommended that most starting Trainers pick up Poké Balls and 
restorative items at the very least.

Retraining
Sometimes, Trainers may wish to go back on certain 
choices. By spending some trainer Experience to 
Retrain, they can spend time changing themselves. 
Retraining should be done during resting periods In-
Character, and between sessions if possible. You must 
have the appropriate amount of Trainer Experience to 
spend; you cannot “go back” a level to do so.
Here are your Retraining options and their associated 
Experience Costs:
»»
You may spend 2 Trainer Experience to Retrain a 
Feature.
»»
You may spend 1 Trainer Experience to Retrain an 
Edge.
»»
You may spend 1 Trainer Experience to move one 
Stat Point to another Stat.
There are however, several rules to retraining. 
»»
You cannot Retrain an Edge or Feature that serves 
as a Prerequisite for another Edge or Feature you 
have. This includes Edges that raise skill ranks to the 
appropriate amount.
»»
You cannot Retrain Edges or Features that induce 
permanent effects if you have already used them; 
if you have used Move Tutor or Type Shift, for 
example, you cannot retrain those Features.
»»
You should, in general, consult your GM before 
retraining. If your GM feels you have used the 
Feature too often and too noticeably In-Character, 
it may not make sense for you to Retrain. 
Doxy: Giving players a chance to “Retrain” a few 
times during a campaign without sacrificing 
Experience may be a good idea. This could 
be done simply by GM fiat, or by consulting a specific 
NPC, or … well, you get the idea. 
It would also be generous to let players retrain – 
or even re-do significant portions of their PC – if 
balance changes make their build impossible or very 
suboptimal. Keep in mind this is a fan-made beta 
system, and balance changes are going to be rolling 
through! If you have new players at the table, you 
should give them more wiggle room to respec too.

Tips For New Players
New to the system and feeling a bit overwhelmed by all 
the options in front of you? Or maybe you’re just worried 
about making bad choices on your first character? Either 
way, this page is for you! 
The next few pages describe some of the common 
archetypes in the Pokémon world and how they may 
be constructed with PTU Classes. Pick an archetype 
that interests you, or a character you would like to 
take inspiration from, then follow the advice on which 
Classes to start with and the options for developing 
from there. If that’s still not enough, here are some tips 
and advice to get you started with a very basic character.
First of all, start by picking an Introductory Class. 
These are Ace Trainer, Capture Specialist, Commander, 
Coordinator, Hobbyist, and Mentor. Ace Trainer, 
Commander, and Mentor in particular are very neutral 
to any sort of battling style or Pokémon team preference.
Then, pair that with either a Battling Style Class or a 
Specialist Team Class. The latter will do more to restrict 
what kinds of Pokémon you want to capture as the 
campaign goes on, but it will also make it much easier 
for you to make decisions about captures and your 
team. The former will give you a little more wiggle room 
in choosing Pokémon and will define your character’s 
playstyle. 
For example, pairing an Ace Trainer, Mentor, or 
Commander with a Cheerleader, Enduring Soul, or 
Duelist makes for an easy starting build. 
Don’t want to follow such a rigid template but still need 
help deciding what to do? Well, in general, for a new 
player, it is best to create a focused build that doesn’t try 
to do too many different things. The roles listed by each 
Class can help you here. Pick Classes with 1 or 2 roles 
listed rather than 3 or more, and try to match them up. 
Broadly speaking, you can choose between supporting 
your Pokémon in battle, or being a  direct combatant 
yourself. Trainer Combat Classes match best with each 
other, but you can make more passive Pokémon Support 
options like Mentor and Ace Trainer work too.
When you start gaining the bonuses that give you 
progression choices at Level 5, 10, 20, etc., you’ll want 
to remain focused here as well. Trainer Combat builds 
want to pick the Stat Points while others generally want 
the Edges or General Features.
Think ahead a little with your Skill choices too. Have 
a Class you want to take further down the line? Start 
investing the bonus Edges you get early on towards the 
prerequisites for that Class so you don’t find yourself 
unable to take it when the time is right.

Building Trainer Archetypes
As you think about how you want to build your character, you may turn to the Pokémon anime, manga, or other 
media for inspiration. The archetypes in Pokémon canon can be easily reproduced in Pokémon Tabletop United by 
mixing and matching classes. If you’re new to the system or simply stumped on how to build a certain archetype, 
read on for a list of archetypes and some introductory advice on building them! 
Even if you know what you’re doing, this section can still help you come up with ideas to complete your Trainer’s 
build or put a new twist on your concept. 
The Spirited Battler
This Trainer achieves victory through sheer tenacity 
and spirit, believing in their Pokémon 100%. They may 
not necessarily use the most naturally powerful species 
or display the best understanding of tactics, but their 
hard work and training will carry them to great heights.
Notable Examples: Ash
Key Skills: Charm, Command
How to Build: Start with Ace Trainer or Cheerleader. 
Ace Trainer gives you a leg up in battle even when using 
weaker Pokémon, provided you’re able and willing to 
put the time in each day to train them. Their Features 
tend to emphasize hard work and training, and they’re 
a good representation of how Spirited Battlers approach 
Pokémon battling. 
Cheerleader provides options such as Go, Fight, Win! 
which simulate how Trainers such as Ash can pull 
victory from the jaws of defeat through having faith in 
their Pokémon.
The General Feature Orders and Training Features 
are also good options for Spirited Battlers wanting to 
expand their active options. The Duelist Class also fits 
well, gaining momentum over time in a fight. 
From there, Spirited Battlers can expand into Enduring 
Soul if they want their Pokémon to be tough enough to 
power through many battles with force of will or into 
Mentor to represent their belief in their Pokémon and 
their strong bonds unlocking the hidden potential of 
their Pokémon. 
The Caretaker
This Trainer is the team mom or dad of their traveling 
party. They make sure that everyone, human and 
Pokémon alike, is well fed and taken care of. They may 
or may not be the best battlers, but you can be sure 
they’re who you want to see after a tough battle. 
Notable Examples: Brock, Daisy Oak
Key Skills: Intuition, Medicine Education
How to Build: Start with Mentor, Researcher, or Chef
The Mentor is the quintessential caretaker, truly 
proving that nurture can overcome a Pokémon’s nature 
and drawing out the hidden potential of a Pokémon 
through diligent care. 
Trainers embodying the Caretaker archetype are often 
skilled Pokémon breeders, and Pokémon Caretaking 
brand of Researcher perfectly fits these characters. Not 
only can they ensure their eggs produce a particular 
special Pokémon, but they can make their Pokémon 
excel in their Special Capabilities. 
The Chef and the Researcher branches that craft 
medicine and grow herbs provide the most direct 
caretaking role, supplying their companions with food 
and taking care of their medical treatment respectively. 
From there, what Classes you choose will largely depend 
on your focus. Caretakers often run the risk of falling 
into a rut of having no actions to take in battle or places 
to spend their AP. Those who want a more active role 
in battle should consider the Sage so they can give their 
party Blessings in battle. Caretakers who are concerned 
with leading their companions through the wilderness 
safely may end up taking the Survivalist Class.

The Tactician
This Trainer aims to win with smarts, not brawn. 
They’re focused on developing the most effective tactics 
to win, and they may employ a wide range of Pokémon 
focusing on using Status Afflictions, Hazards, Blessings, 
and clever combinations of Pokémon and Moves to 
overcome foes with more sheer offensive strength. 
Notable Examples: Red, Conway
Key Skills: Guile, Intuition, Command
How to Build: Start with Commander or Mentor
The Commander is the quintessential class for a 
Tactician character. They focus on using Orders to 
enhance particular strategies such as using high critical 
hit rate Moves or making inaccurate attacks more 
reliable. They’re also able to make the most of hazards, 
buffs, and other indirect and support Moves.  Mentor of 
course is a great fit for this archetype as well with their 
ability to teach Pokémon Moves earlier than normal 
and allow them to retain more Moves.
Even without Mastermind, all of the Orders in the 
General Features are good choices for a Tactician and 
represent their ability to quickly give their Pokémon 
tactical advice on the fly.
You may also want to focus on Ace Trainer early on 
for the boosts to EXP and the benefits of Trained Stats. 
Later on, Ace’s Signature Technique Feature can give 
Tacticians a crucial edge in battle and a unique battling 
style.
Other good choices include the Classes that specialize 
in a certain subset of Pokémon, such as the Type and 
Stat Aces and the Style Expert. Juggler also makes 
an interesting Tactician option due to the all of the 
strategies made available with the ability to quickly 
cycle through a team of Pokémon. Tacticians who want 
to shy away from direct assaults and instead outwit their 
opponents with tricky Status-Class Moves may pick up 
the Trickster Class.
Tacticians should be careful, however, not to overwhelm 
themselves with outlets for AP and Standard Actions in 
battle given their often high use of Orders and reliance 
on Active Pokémon Support Classes. It can be a good 
idea to pick up a Class more focused on Passive Pokémon 
Support after nabbing your core Classes, which is why 
the Stat and Type Aces were recommended.
The Professor’s Assistant
This Trainer isn’t out to win the Pokémon League 
and become champion of the region. Their reason for 
traveling is more about helping a Professor with their 
research and learning more about Pokémon. 
Notable Examples: Crystal, Gary 
Key Skills: Education Skills
How to Build: Start with Capture Specialist or 
Researcher. 
In the early levels, having more Edges available to gain 
Skill Ranks is important, particularly in Education 
Skills such as Pokémon Education. Researcher is an 
obvious option that allows a Trainer to quickly gain 
many Education Skill Ranks at a low level. 
If building a Trainer who isn’t as focused on academic 
study and emphasizes helping their Professor with 
field work, consider a class like Capture Specialist or 
Hobbyist. Hobbyist provides valuable additional Skill 
Ranks for low level Trainers but doesn’t bind them to 
Education Skills like Researcher does while Capture 
Specialist allows a Trainer to excel at the classical task 
given to Pokédex holders: catching ‘em all.
From there, your choice of where to expand will largely 
depend on the goals of your research and study. 
A Professor’s Assistant more geared towards field work 
and observation may go into Survivalist to get better 
at navigating the wilderness or Hunter to aid in their 
capturing activities. Chronicler may also be valuable for 
their Travel Archives and would fit the high Perception 
needed for the job. 
A more academic Professor’s Assistant or someone 
aiming to become a Professor themselves will likely dig 
deep into the particular Field of Study they’re interested 
in, possibly taking multiple instances of the Researcher 
Class as they master more fields. The Chemisty branch 
is a good option for Trainers who may wish to make 
their own Pokémon as part of their research, for 
example, while Fossil Pokémon experts would choose 
Paleontology.


## Page 26

The Specialist
This Trainer hones in on a particular subset of Pokémon, 
whether it be an elemental Type, Pokémon that excel at 
certain Combat Stats, or some other category such as 
the kind of animal the Pokémon is based on. 
Notable Examples: Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains
Key Skills: Various Skills, Command
How to Build: Start with Enduring Soul, Stat Ace or 
Type Ace
The most common and accessible specializations in 
Pokémon are Type and Stat. Gym Leaders and Elite 
Four Members in the handheld games are specialized 
in a Type, for example. This makes Stat Ace and Type 
Ace natural options for a Specialist. Enduring Soul 
can be thought of as a pseudo-HP Ace at times, so it is 
also a good option for those seeking hardy Pokémon 
but not wanting to commit to a defensive Stat.
Even if you’re creating a character whose specialization 
is in a certain kind of animal, these two classes can 
often fit well. For example, a turtle Specialist who 
wants to raise a Torterra, a Torkoal, a Blastoise, etc 
could be a Defense Ace. A lizard Specialist wouldn’t be 
remiss with choosing Dragon Ace, even if they intend 
to include Pokémon such as Krookodile on their team 
– those team members can simply be Type Shifted. 
From there, it’s simply a matter of how else you want 
to support your Pokémon team or whether you instead 
wish to expand into different roles. Specialists in a 
certain animal category are often Researchers, and you 
may create, for example, a Rock Ace specializing in 
Fossil Pokémon or a Grass Ace specializing in growing 
Berries and general botany. 
There are a few other Classes which easily lend 
themselves to certain specializations. Fighting Aces 
and Attack Aces might be Martial Artists, Psychic 
Aces might choose any of the Psychic Classes, and 
Ghost Aces may choose Hex Maniac. 
Each Combat Stat has a Contest Stat equivalent, so it 
isn’t uncommon to see Stat Aces choose Style Expert 
as a class either. 
The Sportsman
This Trainer values an active lifestyle above all else and 
treats their Pokémon as exercise buddies in addition 
to the normal companionship between Trainer and 
Pokémon. A Sportsman will often choose Pokémon 
suiting their sport or physical activity of choice, such 
as skiers picking Ice Types and marathoners picking 
Pokémon like Dodrio that can keep up in a footrace. 
Notable Examples: Korrina, Marlon
Key Skills: Athletics, Acrobatics, Combat
How to Build: Start with Athlete, Tumbler, or Martial 
Artist
In a world filled with dangerous wild Pokémon, 
it’s never a bad idea to get physically fit. It’s for this 
reason that the athletic options in Pokémon Tabletop 
United tend to coincide with martial arts and self-
defense. Each of the Athlete, Tumbler, and Martial 
Artist Classes specializes in Trainer Combat. If this 
doesn’t necessarily fit your character concept, such as 
for a triathlete or swimmer, then the Athlete class is 
probably your best bet out of the three. 
Don’t forget to look into appropriate Edges such as 
Power Boost, Swimmer, Acrobat, etc. when it comes to 
building your Trainer. 
From there, consider what role you want your Trainer 
to play. Fighters will often find Dancer to supplement 
their primary Trainer Combat Class well, while those 
who prefer battling with Pokémon will find a natural fit 
with the Enduring Soul, letting their Pokémon match 
themselves in tenacity. Juggler also puts a Trainer’s 
athleticism to good use in Pokémon battles.
Survivalist is also a great option for many Sportsmen, 
since a love of sports often goes hand in hand with 
a love of the outdoors. They can gain bonuses to 
common Skill Checks used for athletic activity in the 
environment of their choice, such as tundra for skiers 
and mountains for hikers. 
The Weapon Specialist Classes from the Game of 
Throhs supplement fit Sportsmen who’ve chosen to 
study a weapon for their sport.

The Outdoorsman
This Trainer prides themselves on their skill in handling 
the wilds. Often, they are committed to field research to 
further humanity’s knowledge of Pokémon or help out 
with conservation efforts, but this isn’t always the case. 
Notable Examples: Solana, Lunick
Key Skills: Survival, Athletics, Perception
How to Build: Start with Survivalist, Hunter, or Rider
The Survivalist is the obvious choice for this Archetype. 
They can master a variety of different terrains and help 
their Pokémon adapt to them too. Not only that, but 
they are a battling force to be reckoned with the wilds, 
able to teach their Pokémon to use the environment to 
their advantage. In comparison Hunters forgo studying 
the landscape in order to master ways of hunting their 
quarry in the outdoors. 
Exploring the wilds is hard work, and many Trainers 
choose to become Riders to make the task easier. Not 
only do Pokémon often have an easier time traversing 
rough terrain, but fighting on them is advantageous too.
From there, the Athlete and other physically oriented 
options are popular for Outdoorsmen. Making it 
through the wilderness unscathed is not just a matter 
of knowing basic survival skills. It helps a lot to be 
physically fit too.
Enduring Soul is probably the most logical and popular 
Pokémon Support Class for the Outdoorsman, and it 
can help a Trainer’s team shake off Injuries over the 
course of long treks away from a Pokémon Center. 
Along similar lines, the Apothecary and Botany 
branches in Researcher are a great boon to any group 
of Trainers taking long trips through the wilderness, 
and many Outdoorsmen study at least basic medicine. 
Researchers also often must conduct their field work in 
the outdoors and even develop skills for dealing with 
harsh conditions, such as the Climatology branch.
Many Outdoorsman are in it for the sightseeing, and 
Chronicler and other Perception-reliant Classes make 
a good choice for this type of Trainer. 
Finally, it’s always a good idea to learn some self-defense 
if you might run into an angry Ursaring with nowhere to 
run in the woods. Martial Artist makes a good addition 
to any Outdoorsman’s Classes. 
The Performer
This Trainer dedicates their life to putting on stunning 
performances and dazzling an audience. They may or 
may not focus on Pokémon battling, but you can be 
sure they would make every battle they participate in a 
spectacle to behold. 
Notable Examples: Roxie, Dawn, Yancy, Curtis, Ruby
Key Skills: Charm, Intuition, Focus
How to Build: Start with Coordinator, Dancer, or 
Musician
First, you’ll want to think about what kind of performer 
your Trainer is. Obviously, a specialist in Pokémon 
Contests would choose the Coordinator Class, and 
the other two Classes are self-explanatory. However, if 
you haven’t selected your performance art of choice yet, 
think a little about the roles each Trainer Class excels in. 
A Coordinator obviously will focus more on supporting 
their Pokémon than fighting in battle themselves. 
Dancer and Musician, however, share some similarities 
in focusing on Trainer Combat while also being able 
to support their Pokémon to a degree. In the Pokémon 
world, punk rock stars and breakdancers can hold their 
own in a fight too! Musician gives you more tools out of 
the box to fight directly alongside your Pokémon while 
Dancer works better as a supplement to another Trainer 
Combat class with its Combat Stage raising Moves. 
From there, you will again want to think about what 
kind of role your character will play. Style Expert is the 
natural choice for all performers, not just Coordinators, 
when it comes to a Pokémon Support role. Juggler 
matches a flashy battling style as well while also 
providing a bonus to competing in Contests.
A Dancer focusing more on Trainer Combat will 
likely move into Martial Artist, using their graceful 
techniques to perform hypnotizing katas that turn into 
furious and devastating attacks in battle. 
Fashionista is a choice that should appeal to all 
performers, giving them the ability to customize their 
sense of personal style with makeovers and Accessories. 
With the Hobbyist, the performer can become 
incredibly versatile when it comes to all manner of 
social Skills.

The Jack of all Trades
This Trainer doesn’t have any particular specialty and 
largely takes life as it comes at them. They’ll pick up 
the skills they need for their current situation and then 
move on, always seeing and learning new things. 
Notable Examples: Youngster Joey
Key Skills: All of them!
How to Build: Start with Hobbyist
The Jack of All Trades needs a variety of Edges and Skills 
starting from the very beginning, which the Hobbyist 
class is well positioned to supply. Most likely, if you’re 
building towards this archetype, then you will be 
spreading Skill Edges out over a variety of Skills rather 
than concentrating them.
This means that you will likely want to choose Classes 
which don’t require a heavy amount of specialization in 
one Skill to advance in them, and you may also wish 
to consult the markings for each Class’s roles to choose 
options that emphasize a variety of roles rather than 
focusing on just one. 
The Researcher is great for this approach, as it provides 
you with extra Skill Edges to spread in Education Skills 
while giving you a variety of categories with Fields of 
Study that you can dip into for versatility. 
When it comes to Pokémon Support Classes, Ace Trainer 
is the most generic option and the one with the most 
potential for battling with a versatile and unspecialized 
style. Mentor can also help you work towards this end 
with its Pokémon customization options. 
Finally, Chronicler is another Class with low 
prerequisites that allows you to dip into a variety of 
different roles. 
The Thug
This Trainer is the rough and tumble type and makes up 
for a lack of quick thinking with using brute force and 
muscle to get their way. They are often equally brutal and 
callous with their opponents and their own Pokémon, 
or they may simply want to keep up an intimidating 
appearance.
Notable Examples: Gonzap
Key Skills: Intimidate, Combat
How to Build: Start with Martial Artist, Taskmaster, 
or Roughneck
Thugs are not about subtlety, and the suggestions for 
their starting Classes reflect that. Out of the Martial 
Artist options, Cruelty is probably the best for the 
unrefined and brutal tactics a Thug uses in fights. The 
Roughneck is not the most refined or well-trained 
fighter, but they are experts at using fear and other 
psychological tactics to gain an edge in battle. The 
Taskmaster trains and battles with their Pokémon in a 
particularly brutal fashion, seeking victory at all costs 
and injuring their Pokémon to motivate them to fight 
harder. 
From there, many Thugs take more traditional 
Pokémon battling Classes that nonetheless cater to 
their proclivities such as Attack or Defense Ace, as 
well as Tough Expert, to round out their skill sets. It’s 
not unheard of or particularly odd for a Thug to take 
multiple instances of Martial Artist either.
Those Thugs who have a more disciplined side to them 
often choose the Athlete or Ace Trainer Classes, as 
their rough and tumble lifestyles often make them good 
at keeping up with physical training. On the other hand, 
a Thug could embrace their undisciplined rage with the 
Berserker Class from Game of Throhs.
Thugs run the danger of being rather homogeneous in 
concept and execution, so it can be a good idea to give 
the Archetype a twist if you end up going with it. A punk 
rocker Musician who focuses on using the Screech and 
Metal Sound Moves can make a great complement to a 
Roughneck, for example.

The Thief
This Trainer steals, lies, and cheats their way through 
life, and Pokémon training is no exception. Grunts in 
criminal Teams make up the majority of those who 
represent this Archetype, though it’s perfectly possible 
to be a career criminal without being tied to a larger 
organization. 
Notable Examples: Jessie and James, Bounty Hunter J
Key Skills: Perception, Guile, Stealth
How to Build: Start with Ninja, Rogue, Hunter or 
Capture Specialist
The most important part of stealing is not to be caught, 
and all of the recommended starting Classes can be 
excellent at this task even early on with their extra Skill 
Edges or direct bonuses to Stealth Checks. 
The Ninja adds a number of additional tools that can 
be helpful to a Thief, such as the ability to use Illusions 
or create Smoke Bombs for quick escapes. Capture 
Specialists may eventually aspire to own a Snag Machine 
which would let them put their capturing skills to use 
stealing other Trainers’ Pokémon directly. A Hunter is 
also adept at this task and ensuring foes cannot escape 
them. The Rogue providing tricky Dark-Typed attacks. 
From there, a Thief often must decide if they’re more 
focused on getting the job done by themselves or with 
the help of their Pokémon. Speed Aces can raise a team 
of quick and stealthy Pokémon that make pulling off 
a complex heist that much easier and quicker. On the 
other hand, Martial Artists can forgo the stealth route 
altogether and simply punch out anyone who gets in the 
way of their larcenous lifestyle. Roughneck is another 
great choice for the less subtle Thieves, making use of 
scare tactics to make their muggings easier to pull off. 
Those seeking more of a typical anime Team Rocket 
approach to thievery with complex machinery and 
gadgets may wish to take a look at the Engineer branch 
of Researcher in the Do Porygon Dream of Mareep? 
supplement. It specializes in building the type of robots 
that were often used for crazy thievery shenanigans. 
Finally, Classes that specialize in Perception are handy 
to a Thief as well. For example, a Chronicler can more 
easily scope out a potential mark and be aware of their 
surroundings during the heist. 
The Law Enforcement
This Trainer dedicates their life to chasing down 
criminal scum. With numerous criminal organizations 
like Team Rocket, Team Plasma, and so on and so forth 
wandering about, it’s no wonder the Pokémon world is 
in desperate need of these Trainers! 
Notable Examples: Officer Jenny, Looker
Key Skills: Stealth, Perception, Combat, Survival
How to Build: Start with Rogue, Survivalist, or Hunter
It takes a keen understanding of the criminal mind 
to catch a criminal, making the Rogue a great choice 
for Law Enforcement, despite the name and usual 
connotations. Survivalists and Hunters are also great 
for this Archetype because many crimes are, of course, 
related to Pokémon and their habitats, such as poaching 
or performing unethical experiments on wild Pokémon 
populations. 
From there, Law Enforcement agents usually want to 
focus. They can either pick up direct combat Classes like 
Martial Artist or pick up a Class or two that lets them 
more effectively use their Pokémon to catch criminals. 
The Cheerleader Class works very well for this kind 
of supporting role while the Juggler Class allows Law 
Enforcement agents to quickly remove their Pokémon 
from danger. 
When it comes to actually chasing down and catching 
criminals, few Classes can match the Rider in mobility 
and speed, especially when paired with Speed Ace. 
Weapons are sometimes the sole purview of Law 
Enforcement agents in settings where Trainers are 
expected to use Pokémon for self-defense. As such, the 
Weapon Specialist Classes from the Game of Throhs 
supplement may be a fitting option, even in a campaign 
without fantasy elements. 
In campaigns where players are allowed to choose 
Supernatural Classes, the Oracle and Telepath Classes 
are especially useful for detective characters in rooting 
out information that’s normally inaccessible by 
mundane means.

The Mad Scientist
This Trainer is dedicated to Science! with a capital S 
and an exclamation mark. They desire the pursuit of 
knowledge and creation of mad inventions above all 
else, often disregarding ethics in the process. Many high 
ranking members of criminal Teams tend to be Mad 
Scientists, but this doesn’t mean all Mad Scientists use 
their passion for knowledge toward evil ends. 
Notable Examples: Colress, Xerosic
Key Skills: Medicine Education, Technology Education
How to Build: Start with Researcher
The Chemistry branch of Researcher does everything 
a Mad Scientist would want, from making chemical 
weapons to crafting explosives to creating life itself. 
It also offers specializations such as Fossil Pokémon 
and fighting the occult that might be helpful for this 
archetype. 
To truly dip into crazy technological creations and 
gadgets, however, you’ll need to take a look at the sci-
fi supplement for PTU, Do Porygon Dream of Mareep?, 
for more Researcher Branch options. The Upgrader 
builds cybernetic augmentations for themselves and 
their Pokémon and is probably the most representative 
of this archetype. The Engineer specializes in building 
and controlling Pokébots, robots that play a similar role 
to Pokémon. 
Both of these branches are rather high tech and may 
not necessarily fit all campaigns, though keep in mind 
that Pokémon has weird levels of super-tech littered 
throughout its canon. The Jailbreaker, however, is 
suitable for almost any Pokémon campaign that at least 
has Poké Ball technology developed, as it upgrades and 
modifies those crucial capturing tools.
From there, most Mad Scientists focus on Classes for 
Pokémon battling, as their careers demand self-defense 
but don’t lend themselves to learning martial arts very 
well. The Commander is a great fit, as is a Type Ace 
choice for a specialty of the Mad Scientist, such as Poison 
or Steel Types. Mad Scientists who really want to be able 
to defend themselves with their own strength often seek 
Psychic Classes such as Telekinetic, often refluffing the 
powers as highly advanced technology. 
The Sleuth
This Trainer is always looking for the latest scoop, 
whether it’s as news reporters following the hippest 
Trainers around the region or as shady information 
dealers using espionage and stealth to find useful tidbits 
to sell about all the influential and powerful Trainers. 
They could also be talent scouts, searching for potential 
Gym Leaders or competitors at a Battle Frontier. 
Notable Examples: Gabby and Ty
Key Skills: Perception, Charm, Guile
How to Build: Start with Chronicler, Provocateur, or 
Rogue
Sleuths who work in the media obviously tend towards 
the Chronicler Class to begin with. With their talents, 
they can instantly familiarize themselves with new 
environments and capture the details of someone’s 
battle strategy to copy and even replicate and teach to 
their own Pokémon. 
Rogue is a great option for Sleuths who would rather 
remain unseen to get their juicy tidbits of information, 
and the Provocateur can rely upon their silver tongue. 
They’re also more likely to be able to handle themselves 
in a fight, though it might just be enough to run away 
safely rather than beat down a hulky opponent. The 
Tumbler Class also helps here, for the Sleuth who risks 
getting in frequent scuffles. 
For those in a more dangerous Sleuth profession, such as 
information dealers or spies for a criminal organization, 
Trainer Combat Classes such as Ninja or Martial Artist 
are a great choice. 
Sleuths who like to study their opponents and formulate 
clever strategies to use against them will tend toward the 
Commander or Trickster Classes while Sleuths who 
are trying to create their own celebrity identity through 
their media pursuits might choose the Style Expert to 
give their battling a more distinctive flair.

The Gentleman/Lady
This Trainer is a person of refined tastes and behavior 
and is often an older Trainer, tempered by the wisdom 
that come with age. Some of them, however, may be 
boldly passionate, made confident by their years of 
experience and travel. They often hail from high society 
and can be nobility or well known in political circles. 
Notable Examples: Professor Rowan, Diantha
Key Skills: Intuition, Guile, Charm
How to Build: Start with Fashionista or Mentor
This Archetype knows that image is important, and you 
often must wear a different mask to interact with people 
from different walks of life. As such, the Fashionista 
Class serves them well by giving them the ability to 
refashion themselves to meet and socialize with all sorts 
of different social circles. 
The Mentor Class represents what this Archetype has 
to teach to others from either their refined education 
or their years of experience. Gentlemen and Ladies 
work well with Pokémon, understanding the nuances of 
caring for and raising them. 
From there, the Researcher is a great option as well. 
Those from noble or wealthy families tend to have great 
educations and are well-read on a variety of topics. 
Many even go on to become Pokémon Professors.
Hobbyist is also a particularly fitting option, as 
Gentlemen and Ladies often prefer to dabble in a variety 
of skills to maintain their well-rounded educations. 
Gentlemen and Ladies usually enjoy the finer things in 
life, and they may train themselves as Chefs to ensure 
they always have the highest possible standards of food 
for themselves and their Pokémon. 
While many Trainers who embody this Archetype 
may be skilled battlers, it’s also very common for them 
to pursue the more peaceful path of competing in 
Pokémon Contests. The Coordinator and Style Expert 
Classes would help greatly with this, of course. 
Gentlemen and Ladies who find themselves caught in 
the middle of a fight can use the Provocateur Class to put 
their quick wits and social grace to use in disorienting 
their enemies.
The Occultist
This Trainer has no innate supernatural talents but 
nonetheless takes an interest in strange and mysterious 
phenomena, either learning powers through intensive 
study or simply employing Pokémon with those powers. 
This doesn’t make them weaker than those born with 
innate supernatural powers, but it does give them a 
different set of tools to work with. 
Notable Examples: Phoebe
Key Skills: Occult Education
How to Build: Start with Type Ace, Hex Maniac, or 
Sage
Both the Ghost and Psychic Types have a lot to do 
with the occult and supernatural, making Type Ace 
specializing in one of these two Types a great choice for 
a starting Occultist. The Hex Maniac and Sage represent 
schools of learned supernatural power. They focus on 
the duality of the curses and hexes associated with 
Ghost Types contrasted with the wards and blessings 
that counteract those. 
From there, it’s often a good idea for Occultists to 
consider Classes like Enduring Soul that will help them 
and their Pokémon survive looking into ancient ruins 
and other places of occult interest that may harbor 
dangerous Pokémon or other guardians. 
The Rune Master from the Game of Throhs sourcebook 
is also a great choice for an Occultist if the Unown 
feature prominently in a campaign.
The dedicated learning it takes to master the occult arts 
lends itself well to the demands of a Researcher’s life, 
and the study of crystal Shards and the items that can 
be crafted from them may be of particular interest to an 
Occultist. 
Many Occultists will take the Capture Specialist Class 
to ensure that any Pokémon with odd supernatural 
characteristics or magical influences don’t elude them 
and can be brought back for further study.
Finally, while Occultists may not be born with innate 
powers, they might seek out more extravagant abilities 
in the form of connections with Legendary Pokémon. 
If it’s appropriate for the campaign, the options in 
The Blessed and the Damned make a good fit for these 
Trainers.

The Psychic
This Trainer is a master of classical Psychic powers and 
often has a close tie to the Pokémon Type as well. 
Notable Examples: Sabrina, Tate and Liza
Key Skills: Focus, Intuition, Guile
How to Build: Start with Telekinetic, Telepath, or 
Warper
Terrifying stories are often told of Psychics. It’s said they 
can read your mind, move objects with just a thought, 
teleport in the blink of an eye, and even see the future. 
While Psychics can do all of these, very few Psychics 
can do all of them or even just more than one. When 
building a Psychic, your first choice is which power 
set to focus on, because each of them will consume a 
precious Class slot. 
Telepaths find the most use outside of combat situations 
and are great for Travel and Investigation with their 
ability to ferret out secrets and discover the hidden and 
unknown. Telekinetics are the most capable of directly 
applying their powers to fighting, though Warpers also 
have a set of competent combat techniques that can 
enhance any combat Trainer’s arsenal. 
From there, many Psychics also choose to become 
Psychic Aces due to their connection with the Type. 
Rune Master from the Game of Throhs supplement is 
another popular choice due to the Psychic Typing of the 
strange letter Pokémon. 
Psychics who want to enhance their Pokémon training 
in a less specialized way often choose the Enduring 
Soul Class because of the shared use of the Focus Skill 
with many Psychic Classes. 
Many Psychics focus on intellectual pursuits as well, 
due to the universal use of Mind Category Skills within 
their Classes, which makes Researcher a worthy option 
to consider. Some Psychics may wish to develop skills 
in tracking others of their kind, and the Occultism 
Research branch of the Researcher Class allows just that.
The Mystic
This Trainer is an enigma, commanding powers that 
most people don’t understand and may not have even 
heard of. They often develop a closer bond to wild 
Pokémon than most due to their ability to peer directly 
into their hearts and understand them on an intuitive 
level. 
Notable Examples: N, Riley
Key Skills: Intuition, Perception
How to Build: Start with Channeler, Oracle, or Aura 
Guardian
Channelers and Aura Guardians have similar abilities 
to perceive the emotions and intents of others, though 
they manifest in different ways. A Channeler can 
delve deeper into the emotions of a Pokémon, but the 
connection they forge is by necessity more intimate and 
intentional and thus harder to establish with hostile 
foes. An Aura Guardian gets a more shallow glance at 
someone’s heart, but they can do so instantly. 
The two Classes also differ in their role in battle, with the 
Channeler specializing in supporting their Pokémon 
using the connection they build between them and 
Aura Guardians specializing in fighting with Aura 
energy and combat techniques. You may also build a 
Mystic by starting with the Elementalist Classes from 
Game of Throhs.
From there, many Mystics choose to focus further on the 
respective roles of their starting Class. Aura Guardians 
may choose Musician or the Arcanist from Game of 
Throhs to add more Special attacks to their arsenal. 
Channelers often choose other support Classes such as 
Enduring Soul or even Chef to make use of their high 
Intuition. 
Mystics also tend to have connections to Legendary 
Pokémon, and in campaigns where such Pokémon have 
divine or near divine status, the character options from 
The Blessed and the Damned can provide interesting 
ways to represent powers gained from a relationship 
with these rare mythical Pokémon.
Much of the time, however, a Mystic chooses not to 
define themselves just by their supernatural powers, and 
they may develop in many different directions, selecting 
the rest of their Classes as if they were embodying a 
different Trainer Archetype from this section.
