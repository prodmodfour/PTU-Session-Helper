Confined: If Hoopa’s Confined Form is exposed to
the Prison Bottle and the bottle is uncorked, the dark 
spirit within the bottle will change Hoopa to its 
Unbound Forme for three full days. After that, the 
Prison Bottle cannot be activated again for three 
days. If the Prison Bottle is  destroyed, Hoopa be­
comes permanently Unbound until a new Prison 
Bottle is created and used to seal the dark power 
controlling Hoopa. 
While Unbound, Hoopa is always Enraged and can­
not be cured of this condition. Additionally some of 
its Ghost-Typed Moves are changed to different Dark 
Type Moves.
-> Hyperspace Hole becomes Hyperspace Fury.
-> Shadow Ball becomes Dark Pulse
-> Phantom Force becomes Knock Off
