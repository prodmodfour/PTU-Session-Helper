Dragon Fusion: The user can merge with a willing 
Zekrom as an Extended Action to turn into the Zekrom 
Fusion  Forme, and with a willing Reshiram to turn into 
its Reshiram Fusion Forme. The respective Zekrom and 
Reshiram are absorbed and disappear while Fused. The 
user may unmerge as an Extended Action, and its partner 
then reappears. All XP earned while Fused is split evenly 
between Kyurem and its partner.
