Rotoms in their Appliance Forms retain most of the 
same Basic Information as their Normal Form. 
However, their Types, Size Information, Capabili­
ties, Skill List, and even Move List will change upon 
changing forms. We’ve provided the standard set of 
Appliance Forms here and what changes to apply 
for them, but GMs should feel free to make up new 
forms of their own.
