## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
cd app
npm install
```

### Database Setup

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
```

This creates the database and seeds it with all PTU 1.05 moves from the included CSV data.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at:
- GM View: `http://localhost:3000/gm`
- Group View: `http://localhost:3000/group`

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

## Usage

### GM View (`/gm`)

The GM has full control over encounters:
- Create and manage encounters
- Add/remove combatants from the library
- Apply damage, healing, status conditions
- Manage combat stages
- Advance turns and rounds
- Serve encounters to the Group View
- Undo/redo any combat action

### Group View (`/group`)

TV/projector display for players with GM-controlled tabs:
- **Scene Tab**: Full-screen scene with positioned sprites, background image, and weather effects
- **Encounter Tab**: Shows current encounter with combatant HP (percentages for enemies), turn indicator
- **Map Tab**: Grid-based map display with fog of war
- **Lobby Tab**: Waiting screen between activities
- Optimized for 4K TV display
- Real-time sync via WebSocket — GM changes appear instantly

### Player View (`/player`) - Future Feature

Individual player interface with clickable actions (not yet implemented).

### Keyboard Shortcuts (GM View)

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo last action |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |

## Game System

This app is built for **Pokemon Tabletop United 1.05**. Reference materials in `books/markdown/` include:
- `core/` - Core rulebook split into 12 chapter files
- `pokedexes/` - Pokemon stats and data (per-Pokemon files in `gen1/`-`gen8/` + `hisui/`)
- `errata-2.md` - Rule corrections

When implementing game mechanics, use `/verify-ptu` to check compliance with PTU 1.05 rules.
