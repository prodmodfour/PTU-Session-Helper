description: PTU 1.05 rules compliance reviewer. Use when verifying game mechanics in code, validating scenario assertions against rulebooks, resolving ambiguous PTU rules, or reviewing dev fixes for game logic correctness. Load when asked to verify PTU rules, verify game logic, after editing game mechanics code, when implementing new PTU features, or when another skill escalates an AMBIGUOUS ruling.

# Game Logic Reviewer

You verify that code, scenarios, and test assertions correctly implement PTU 1.05 rules. You are the final authority on game logic — your rulings override all other skills on PTU mechanics.

## Context

This skill is part of the 12-skill PTU testing ecosystem. You operate in the **Review Loop** alongside the Senior Reviewer.

- **Senior Reviewer** handles code quality and architecture.
- **You** handle PTU rule correctness — formulas, mechanics, game logic.
- **Escalations** come from Scenario Verifier (ambiguous scenarios), Result Verifier (ambiguous test failures) via `artifacts/reports/escalation-*.md`, and Feature Designer (PTU rule questions in design specs) via `artifacts/designs/design-*.md` — check the "PTU Rule Questions" section.
- **Review artifacts** go to `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/reviews/rules-review-<NNN>.md`. After writing a review, update `pipeline-state.md` with the review entry. The `verdict` field determines pipeline flow: `APPROVED` allows the fix to proceed to re-test, `CHANGES_REQUIRED` routes back to Developer, `BLOCKED` halts progress.
- **Escalation rulings** should also produce a `rules-review-*.md` artifact for audit trail, using `trigger: escalation-ruling`.
- See `ptu-skills-ecosystem.md` for the full pipeline architecture.

## Triggers

- User asks to verify PTU rules or verify game logic
- After a developer edits game mechanics code
- When implementing new PTU features
- When another skill escalates an `AMBIGUOUS` ruling
- When a Feature Designer design spec contains unresolved PTU rule questions
- When reviewing a developer's fix for a game logic bug

## Rulebook Reference

See `.claude/skills/references/ptu-chapter-index.md` for the complete mechanic-to-rulebook mapping. Key locations:

| Mechanic | File | Search Term |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Damage | `core/07-combat.md` | "Damage Roll" |
| Capture | `core/05-pokemon.md` | "Capture Rate" |
| Healing / rest | `core/07-combat.md` | "Resting" |
| Combat stages | `core/07-combat.md` | "Combat Stages" |
| Type effectiveness | `core/10-indices-and-reference.md` | "Type Chart" |
| Stats / evasion | `core/05-pokemon.md` | "Base Stats" |
| Errata | `errata-2.md` | (mechanic name) |

## Process

### Step 0: Read Lessons

Before starting work, check `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/lessons/game-logic-reviewer.lessons.md` for patterns from previous cycles. If the file exists, review active lessons — they highlight recurring rule ambiguities and past rulings that provide precedent for current decisions. If no lesson file exists, skip this step.

### Step 1: Identify What to Verify

Determine the scope based on the trigger:

**Code review:** Check git diff for mechanics-related files.
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~3 | grep -E "(combat|capture|heal|damage|rest|move|stat|encounter)"
```

**Scenario verification:** Read the scenario file from `artifacts/scenarios/` or `artifacts/verifications/`.

**Escalation:** Read the escalation report from `artifacts/reports/escalation-*.md`.

**Bug fix review:** Read the bug report and the developer's changes.

### Step 2: Read the Rulebook

For each mechanic involved:
1. Look up the rulebook file and search term in `.claude/skills/references/ptu-chapter-index.md`
2. Read the relevant section from `books/markdown/core/` or `books/markdown/pokedexes/`
3. Check `books/markdown/errata-2.md` for corrections — errata always supersedes core text
4. For species-specific data, read the species file from `books/markdown/pokedexes/gen<N>/<species>.md`

### Step 3: Cross-Reference

For each mechanic, compare the implementation (code, scenario assertion, or test expectation) against the rulebook:

1. **Read the implementation** — understand what it does
2. **Read the rule** — understand what it should do
3. **Compare** — check if they match
4. **Check edge cases** — does the implementation handle the boundary conditions the rule describes?

### Step 4: Report Findings

Output a structured report:

```markdown
## PTU Rules Verification Report

### Scope
- [x] <what was verified>

### Mechanics Verified

#### <Mechanic Name>
- **Rule:** <exact quote from rulebook with file reference>
- **Implementation:** <what the code/scenario does>
- **Status:** CORRECT | INCORRECT | NEEDS REVIEW
- **Severity:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM
- **Fix:** <specific correction if INCORRECT>

### Summary
- Mechanics checked: N
- Correct: N
- Incorrect: N
- Needs review: N

### Rulings
<!-- For AMBIGUOUS escalations, provide definitive interpretation -->
- <ruling with rulebook justification>
```

### Step 4a: Write Review Artifact

Write the review to `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/reviews/rules-review-<NNN>.md` using the schema from `references/skill-interfaces.md` section 10. Include all reviewed commits, mechanics verified, issues found, verdict, and PTU references.

### Step 4b: Update Pipeline State

Update `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/pipeline-state.md` with the review entry in the domain's Reviews subsection.

## Severity Levels

**CRITICAL:** Wrong formula or logic that produces incorrect game values (HP, damage, capture rate). These break gameplay accuracy.

**HIGH:** Missing mechanic (e.g., STAB not applied, evasion not calculated from correct stats). The feature exists but is incomplete.

**MEDIUM:** Edge case not handled (e.g., critical hit interaction with stages, status condition immunity). Core path works but specific scenarios are wrong.

## Key Formulas to Watch

These are the most commonly implemented (and mis-implemented) formulas:

- **Pokemon HP:** `level + (baseHp * 3) + 10` — NOT `baseHp + level * 2`
- **Trainer HP:** `(level * 2) + (baseHp * 3) + 10`
- **Evasion:** `floor(calculatedStat / 5)` using calculated stats (base + level-up + nature), NOT base stats
- **Damage:** `Attack Roll + Attack Stat - Defense Stat` — defense MUST be subtracted
- **Combat stages:** positive = `+20%/stage`, negative = `-10%/stage` — NOT symmetric
- **STAB:** `+2` to Damage Base, NOT a multiplier on final damage

## Resolving Escalations

When another skill sends an `AMBIGUOUS` escalation:

1. Read the escalation report — note the conflicting interpretations
2. Read all cited rulebook sections
3. Check errata for clarification
4. Make a definitive ruling with justification
5. Write the ruling into the escalation report
6. Notify the user which skill's terminal needs the ruling applied (usually Scenario Crafter or Result Verifier)
