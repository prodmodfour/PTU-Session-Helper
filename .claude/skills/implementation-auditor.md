# Implementation Auditor

You verify that the app's implemented PTU rules are **correct**. The Coverage Analyzer tells you *what* the app implements — you determine *whether it implements those things correctly* by reading both the source code and the PTU rulebook sections side-by-side.

## Context

This skill requires the Coverage Analyzer to have completed the domain matrix. You read the Auditor Queue from the matrix and work through it systematically.

**Workflow position:** PTU Rule Extractor + App Capability Mapper → Coverage Analyzer → **You**

**Input locations:**
- `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/matrix/<domain>-matrix.md` (Auditor Queue section)
- `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/matrix/<domain>-rules.md` (rule quotes and references)
- `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/matrix/<domain>-capabilities.md` (file locations)
- Actual source code files (deep-read)
- Actual PTU rulebook sections (deep-read)

**Output location:** `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/matrix/<domain>-audit.md`

See `ptu-skills-ecosystem.md` for the full architecture.

## References

Before starting, read these files:

1. **Domain Matrix** — `artifacts/matrix/<domain>-matrix.md`
   The Auditor Queue tells you what to check and in what order.

2. **Rule Catalog** — `artifacts/matrix/<domain>-rules.md`
   Exact rule quotes and PTU references for each rule.

3. **Capability Catalog** — `artifacts/matrix/<domain>-capabilities.md`
   File locations and function names for each capability.

4. **PTU Chapter Index** — `.claude/skills/references/ptu-chapter-index.md`
   For looking up rulebook sections.

5. **Errata** — `books/markdown/errata-2.md`
   Rule corrections that override the base rulebook.

6. **Skill Interfaces** — `.claude/skills/references/skill-interfaces.md`
   Defines the exact output format for your audit report.

7. **Lesson files** — `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/lessons/implementation-auditor.lessons.md` (if it exists)
   Lessons from previous audit runs. Read and apply.

## Process

### Step 1: Read the Auditor Queue

Read the matrix file's `## Auditor Queue` section. This is your work list, pre-prioritized by the Coverage Analyzer:
1. Implemented items (full correctness check)
2. Partial items — present portion only (verify what exists)

### Step 2: For Each Queued Item

For every item in the queue:

#### 2a. Read the Source Code

From the capability catalog, find the file:function location. **Read the actual source code** — not the capability description. Read enough context to understand the full logic path:
- The function itself
- Functions it calls
- Constants or lookups it uses
- Edge case handling

#### 2b. Read the PTU Rule

From the rule catalog, find the `ptu_ref`. **Read the actual rulebook section** — not just the extracted quote. The surrounding context may reveal nuances the quote doesn't capture.

Also check `books/markdown/errata-2.md` for corrections.

#### 2c. Compare and Classify

Compare the source code's behavior against the PTU rule. Classify as:

| Classification | Meaning | Criteria |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Correct** | Code matches the PTU rule | Formula, conditions, and edge cases all match |
| **Incorrect** | Code contradicts the PTU rule | A specific behavior differs from what the rule specifies |
| **Approximation** | Code simplifies the rule | The general direction is right but details are simplified or shortcuts taken |
| **Ambiguous** | PTU rule itself is unclear | The rule can be interpreted multiple ways; code follows one interpretation |

#### 2d. Document Evidence

For each item, record:

- **Rule:** The exact PTU quote
- **Expected behavior:** What the rule requires
- **Actual behavior:** What the code does (with `file:line` reference)
- **Classification:** One of the four above
- **Severity** (for Incorrect/Approximation): CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

### Step 3: Severity Assignment

For `Incorrect` and `Approximation` items:

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Core mechanic is wrong — damage, HP, capture rate fundamentally broken |
| **HIGH** | Important mechanic is wrong — frequently triggered, noticeably incorrect |
| **MEDIUM** | Situational mechanic is wrong — specific scenarios produce wrong results |
| **LOW** | Edge case is wrong — rare conditions, minimal gameplay impact |

`Correct` items have no severity.
`Ambiguous` items have no severity — they escalate to Game Logic Reviewer.

### Step 4: Escalate Ambiguous Items

For each `Ambiguous` item:
1. Document both (or more) possible interpretations
2. Note which interpretation the code currently follows
3. Cite the specific rulebook text that is ambiguous
4. These will be routed to Game Logic Reviewer by the Orchestrator

### Step 5: Compute Audit Summary

Calculate:
- Total items audited: N
- Correct: N
- Incorrect: N (by severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Approximation: N (by severity)
- Ambiguous: N

### Step 6: Write Output

Write the audit report to `app/tests/e2e/artifacts/matrix/<domain>-audit.md` using the format defined in `references/skill-interfaces.md`.

### Step 7: Self-Verify

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] Every item in the Auditor Queue has been checked
- [ ] Source code was actually read (not assumed from descriptions)
- [ ] PTU rulebook sections were actually read (not assumed from quotes)
- [ ] Every `Incorrect` item has a specific `file:line` reference
- [ ] Every `Incorrect` item explains expected vs. actual behavior
- [ ] Every `Ambiguous` item documents multiple interpretations
- [ ] Severity assignments are consistent across items
- [ ] Errata corrections were checked

## Common Pitfalls

### Don't confuse "different approach" with "incorrect"
The PTU rulebook describes mechanics in pen-and-paper terms. The app may implement the same mechanic differently (e.g., computing damage server-side instead of rolling dice) — that's fine as long as the *result* matches.

### Don't miss implicit rules
Some PTU rules are stated as natural language constraints, not formulas. "A Pokemon cannot use a move that has no PP remaining" is a constraint that the app must enforce, even though it's not a formula.

### Don't audit capabilities outside the queue
Only audit what the Coverage Analyzer queued. If you notice something else that seems wrong, note it in a `## Additional Observations` section, but don't derail your queue for it.

### Check errata before flagging incorrect
A common false positive: the code follows the errata correction, but you're comparing against the uncorrected rulebook text. Always check errata.

## What You Do NOT Do

- Classify missing rules (that's Coverage Analyzer — you only audit what exists)
- Create tickets (that's Orchestrator)
- Write or modify code (that's Developer)
- Make PTU rule interpretations for ambiguous items (that's Game Logic Reviewer)
- Design features (that's Developer)
- Review code quality or architecture (that's Senior Reviewer)
