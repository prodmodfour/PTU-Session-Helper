»» Gain a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls if targeting anyone outside of the Grapple.
»» Additionally, Grapple has other effects on whether the target has or doesn’t have Dominance.

If a target begins their turn as a part of a Grapple but with no Dominance, they may choose to contest the Grapple as a Full Action. If they do, all participants make opposed Combat or Athletics Check. Whoever wins then may choose to either continue the Grapple and gain Dominance, or to end the Grapple.

If a target has the Phasing or Teleporter Capability, they may also use those to escape from a Grapple on their turn with no check required.

If a target begins their turn as part of a Grapple and has Dominance, they may take one of the following actions as a Full Action.

Effect: You must make an Acrobatics or Athletics Check, with a DC equal to three times the number of meters they have to move to reach the triggering Ally; If you succeed, you Push the triggering Ally 1 Meter away from you, and Shift to occupy their space, and are hit by the triggering attack. On Failure to make the Check, the user still Shifts a number of meters equal a third of their check result.

Note: If the target that was Intercepted was hit by an Area of Effect Move, and the 1 meter push does not remove them from the Area of Effect, the Intercept has no effect since they are still in the area of the attack – it would cause the Interceptor to be hit by the Move however.

Special: Pokemon must have a Loyalty of 3 or greater to make Intercept Melee and Intercept range Maneuvers and may only Intercept attacks against their Trainer. At Loyalty 6, Pokemon may Intercept for any Ally.

Additional Rules
»» Pokémon and Trainers may only Intercept against Priority and Interrupt Moves if they are faster than the user of those Moves.
