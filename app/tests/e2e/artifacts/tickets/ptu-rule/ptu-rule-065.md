## Summary

Encounter end does not clear `boundAp` for human combatants. PTU Core p.59 states Stratagems "automatically unbind when combat ends." The encounter end handler should clear `boundAp: 0` and recalculate `currentAp` for all human combatants with an `entityId`.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core (p.59): "[Stratagem] Features may only be bound during combat and automatically unbind when combat ends."

When an encounter ends via `POST /api/encounters/:id/end`, all trainers who had AP bound in Stratagems should have their `boundAp` cleared to 0 and `currentAp` recalculated to `maxAp - drainedAp`.

## Actual Behavior

The encounter end endpoint (`app/server/api/encounters/[id]/end.post.ts`) clears volatile conditions and resets scene-frequency moves, but does not touch `boundAp` or `currentAp` for human combatants. A trainer with 2 AP bound in a Stratagem retains that penalty until the scene also ends.

## Files to Change

- `app/server/api/encounters/[id]/end.post.ts` -- add `boundAp: 0` clearing and `currentAp` recalculation for human combatants with `entityId`

## Notes

The scene deactivation endpoint (`deactivate.post.ts`) correctly clears `boundAp`, but encounters can end independently of scenes (e.g., GM ends combat mid-scene). Both paths need to handle this.

## Resolution Log

### 2026-02-20 — Fix applied to encounter end endpoint

**File changed:** `app/server/api/encounters/[id]/end.post.ts`

**What was done:**
- Imported `calculateSceneEndAp` from `~/utils/restHealing`
- After the existing sync loop (volatile conditions + scene-frequency moves), added a new block that:
  1. Collects all human combatant `entityId` values from the encounter
  2. Fetches their DB records (`level`, `drainedAp`) via `prisma.humanCharacter.findMany`
  3. For each character, sets `boundAp: 0` and `currentAp: calculateSceneEndAp(level, drainedAp)`
- Updated file docstring to reference PTU Core p.59 Stratagem unbinding rule

**Pattern followed:** Matches `app/server/api/scenes/[id]/deactivate.post.ts` which already clears `boundAp` at scene end using the same `calculateSceneEndAp` utility.

**Other code paths checked:**
- `POST /api/encounters/:id/end` — the only server-side encounter-end path (store calls this single endpoint)
- Scene deactivation (`deactivate.post.ts`) — already handles `boundAp` clearing (no change needed)
- Extended rest (`extended-rest.post.ts`) — already clears `boundAp` (no change needed)
- New day endpoints — already clear `boundAp` (no change needed)
- Scene activation (`activate.post.ts`) — already clears `boundAp` when deactivating other scenes (no change needed)
