## Summary

Take a Breather's forced 2-square shift movement away from enemies is not automated on the VTT grid. The GM must manually move the token after executing a Breather.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core: after Taking a Breather, the character must Shift (2 squares) away from all adjacent enemies.

## Actual Behavior

The Breather maneuver applies HP healing and condition removal but does not trigger automatic grid movement.
