## Summary

Manual character creation form only covers stats and name. Missing fields: edges, features, skills, classes, age, background, personality, goals. Requires CSV import for full character setup.

## Expected Behavior

Character creation should allow setting all PTU character fields including class selection, skill allocation, feature/edge selection, and biographical details.

## Actual Behavior

The manual creation form is a minimal stub. Full character data can only be entered via CSV import or post-creation PUT endpoint editing.
