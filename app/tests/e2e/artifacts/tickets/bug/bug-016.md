## Summary

Pokemon generation hard-caps spawn count at 10, making the "Abundant" density tier (12-16 Pokemon) impossible to achieve. The cap contradicts the app's own density tier constants.

## Expected Behavior

Abundant density tier should spawn 12-16 Pokemon per the app's defined constants. The generation cap should respect the configured density ranges.

## Actual Behavior

A hard-coded `Math.min(count, 10)` (or similar) caps all encounter generation at 10 Pokemon regardless of the density tier. Abundant encounters are clamped to 10, making them identical to "Common" or "Uncommon" tiers.

## Affected Files

- `app/server/api/encounter-tables/` — generation endpoint
- `app/constants/` — density tier definitions
