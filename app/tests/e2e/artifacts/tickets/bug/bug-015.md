## Summary

Features and Edges cannot be updated via the character PUT endpoint. These fields are frozen after creation or CSV import. This prevents duplicate feature prevention (R037) and makes retraining impossible (R055).

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Trainers should be able to gain new Features and Edges as they level up, and retrain existing ones per PTU retraining rules. The app should allow editing these fields.

## Actual Behavior

The PUT endpoint for characters does not handle `features` or `edges` fields. Once set during creation or CSV import, they cannot be modified through the API. Three audit findings trace to this root cause:
- R033: Features/edges not updatable via PUT
- R037: No duplicate feature prevention (can't edit to check)
- R055: Retraining impossible (can't swap features/edges)

## Affected Files

- `app/server/api/characters/[id].put.ts` — missing features/edges in update body handling

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 1 — Features and Edges, Retraining
