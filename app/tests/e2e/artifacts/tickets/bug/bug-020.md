## Summary

Disarm and Dirty Trick combat maneuvers are missing from the COMBAT_MANEUVERS constant array. All other PTU standard maneuvers (Push, Sprint, Trip, Grapple, Intercept, Take a Breather) are present.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core: Disarm forces target to drop held item on failed opposed check. Dirty Trick applies a status condition of the user's choice for one round.

## Actual Behavior

These maneuvers are absent from the constants and cannot be selected in the combat UI.

## Affected Files

- `app/constants/combatManeuvers.ts` — maneuver definitions

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 8 — Combat Maneuvers

## Fix Log

**2026-02-20** — Added Disarm and Dirty Trick maneuver definitions to `app/constants/combatManeuvers.ts`. Disarm: Standard, AC 6, Melee 1 Target, opposed Combat/Stealth. Dirty Trick: Standard, AC 2, Melee 1 Target, Hinder/Blind/Low Blow sub-options once per Scene per target. Updated `app/composables/useEncounterActions.ts` with maneuver name mapping and standard action consumption for both new maneuvers. Verified ManeuverGrid.vue auto-imports from COMBAT_MANEUVERS.
