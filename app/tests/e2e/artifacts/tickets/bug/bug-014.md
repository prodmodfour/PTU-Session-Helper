## Summary

Take a Breather unconditionally removes the Cursed condition without checking the PTU prerequisite: the curse source must be KO'd or more than 12 meters away.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core: Cursed can only be removed by Take a Breather if the source of the curse is Knocked Out or more than 12 meters (6 squares) away from the cursed character.

## Actual Behavior

Take a Breather clears Cursed regardless of the curse source's status or distance. This makes Curse trivially easy to remove.

## Affected Files

- `app/composables/useRestHealing.ts` or combat maneuver handler — Breather condition clearing logic

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 9 — Take a Breather, Curse Condition
