## Summary

No scene-end AP restoration mechanism exists. Only drainedAp tracking and Extended Rest AP restore are implemented. AP is not automatically replenished when a scene ends.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core: Action Points are completely regained at the end of each scene. Only AP lost to Drain effects remain unavailable until restored by Extended Rest.

## Actual Behavior

There is no scene-end trigger that restores AP. The app tracks `drainedAp` but has no concept of current AP pool, total AP, or scene-boundary restoration.

## Affected Files

- Scene deactivation endpoints
- Character/Pokemon AP tracking (currently only `drainedAp` field exists)

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 8 — Action Points, Scene Boundaries
