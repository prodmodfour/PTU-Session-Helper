## Summary

Stat point allocation during Pokemon generation uses `level - 1` instead of `level + 10`. Every generated Pokemon receives 11 fewer stat points than PTU specifies.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core: a Pokemon has `level + 10` stat points to distribute across its 6 stats at generation. A level 5 Pokemon should have 15 stat points. A level 20 Pokemon should have 30 stat points.

## Actual Behavior

The pokemon-generator.service uses `level - 1` as the stat point pool. A level 5 Pokemon gets 4 stat points instead of 15. A level 20 Pokemon gets 19 instead of 30.

## Impact

Every Pokemon generated by the app has significantly lower stats than intended. At low levels, the difference is extreme (level 1: 0 points instead of 11). This makes all wild spawns, template loads, and manually generated Pokemon weaker than their PTU equivalents.

## Affected Files

- `app/server/services/pokemon-generator.service.ts` — `generatePokemonData()` stat allocation

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 2 — Creating Pokemon, Stat Point Distribution

## Resolution Log

- **Commit:** `73074a1`
- **Date:** 2026-02-19
- **Change:** In `app/server/services/pokemon-generator.service.ts`, changed `distributeStatPoints` to use `level + 10` instead of `level - 1` for stat point allocation. Updated the comment on `generatePokemonData` and the `distributeStatPoints` docstring to reflect the correct PTU formula.
- **Files modified:** `app/server/services/pokemon-generator.service.ts`
- **Tests:** All 476 unit tests pass.
