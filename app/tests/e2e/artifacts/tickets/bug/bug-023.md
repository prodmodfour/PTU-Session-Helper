## Summary

Accuracy check auto-selects damage-class-matching evasion (Physical attack → Physical Evasion, Special attack → Special Evasion) but ignores Speed Evasion entirely. PTU allows the defender to use Speed Evasion against any attack with an accuracy check.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core p.234: "Speed Evasion may be applied to any Move with an accuracy check, but you may only add one of your three evasions to any one check." The defender should use whichever evasion is highest — the damage-class-matching one or Speed Evasion.

## Recommended Fix

Per Game Logic Reviewer ruling (rules-review-047): use `Math.max(matchingEvasion, speedEvasion)` to auto-select the best available evasion for the defender.

## Affected Files

- Accuracy check logic (wherever evasion is selected for the threshold calculation)

## PTU Reference

- Core p.234 — Evasion Rules, Speed Evasion
