## Summary

VTT terrain types do not match PTU terrain definitions. Earth terrain (requires Burrow capability to traverse) and Rough terrain (-2 accuracy penalty) are missing. Hazard and Elevated are app-specific additions not in PTU.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Per PTU Core terrain types: Normal, Slow (2x movement cost), Blocking (impassable without flight/phase), Rough (-2 accuracy), Earth (requires Burrow). The VTT should support all PTU terrain types.

## Actual Behavior

The terrain painter supports: Normal, Slow, Blocking, Water, Hazard, Elevated. Missing: Earth, Rough. Present but non-PTU: Hazard, Elevated.

## Affected Files

- `app/types/terrain.ts` or terrain type definitions
- `app/composables/useTerrainPersistence.ts`
- Terrain painter UI components

## PTU Reference

- Core Chapter 8 — Terrain Types
